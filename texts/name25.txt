Baltic states are not members of the UN and are not included in the list of nations The US Government does not recognize the four socalled independent homelands of Bophuthatswana Ciskei Transkei and Venda in South Africa Gross domestic product GDP The value of all goods and services produced domestically Gross national product GNP The value of all goods and services produced domestically plus income earned abroad minus income earned by foreigners from domestic production GNPGDP methodology In the Economy section GNPGDP dollar estimates for the OECD countries the USSR and the East European countries are derived from purchasing power parity PPP calculations rather than from conversions at official currency exchange rates The PPP method normally involves the use of international dollar price weights which are applied to the quantities of goods and services produced in a given economy In addition to the lack of reliable data from the majority of countries the statistician faces a major difficulty in specifying identifying and allowing for the quality of goods and services The division of a PPP GNPGDP estimate in dollars by the corresponding estimate in the local currency gives the PPP conversion rate One thousand dollars will buy the same market basket of goods in the US as one thousand dollars converted to the local currency at the PPP conversion rate will buy in the other country GNPGDP estimates for the LDCs on the other hand are based on the conversion of GNPGDP estimates in local currencies to dollars at the official currency exchange rates One caution the proportion of say defense expenditures as a percent of GNPGDP in local currency accounts may differ substantially from the proportion when GNPGDP accounts are expressed in PPP terms as for example when an observer estimates the dollar level of Soviet or Japanese military expenditures similar problems exist when components are expressed in dollars under currency exchange rate procedures Finally as academic research moves forward on the PPP method we hope to convert all GNPGDP estimates to this method in future editions of the Factbook Growth rate population The annual percent change in the population resulting from a surplus or deficit of births over deaths and the balance of migrants entering and leaving a country The rate may be positive or negative Illicit drugs There are five categories of illicit drugsnarcotics stimulants depressants sedatives hallucinogens and cannabis These categories include many drugs legally produced and prescribed by doctors as well as those

for the foreseeable future Maritime claims The proximity of neighboring states may prevent some national claims from being fully extended Merchant marine All ships engaged in the carriage of goods All commercial vessels as opposed to all nonmilitary ships which excludes tugs fishing vessels offshore oil rigs etc Also a grouping of merchant ships by nationality or register Captive registerA register of ships maintained by a territory possession or colony primarily or exclusively for the use of ships owned in the parent country Also referred to as an offshore register the offshore equivalent of an internal register Ships on a captive register will fly the same flag as the parent country or a local variant of it but will be subject to the maritime laws and taxation rules of the offshore territory Although the nature of a captive register makes it especially desirable for ships owned in the parent country just as in the internal register the ships may also be owned abroad The captive register then acts as a flag of convenience register except that it is not the register of an independent state Flag of convenience registerA national register offering registration to a merchant ship not owned in the flag state The major flags of convenience FOC attract ships to their register by virtue of low fees low or nonexistent taxation of profits and liberal manning requirements True FOC registers are characterized by having relatively few of the ships registered actually owned in the flag state Thus while virtually any flag can be used for ships under a given set of circumstances an FOC register is one where the majority of the merchant fleet is owned abroad It is also referred to as an open register Flag stateThe nation in which a ship is registered and which holds legal jurisdiction over operation of the ship whether at home or abroad Differences in flag state maritime legislation determine how a ship is manned and taxed and whether a foreignowned ship may be placed on the register Internal registerA register of ships maintained as a subset of a national register Ships on the internal register fly the national flag and have that nationality but are subject to a separate set of maritime rules from those on the main national register These differences usually include lower taxation of profits manning by foreign nationals and usually ownership outside the flag state when it functions as an FOC register The Norwegian International Ship Register and Danish International Ship Register are the most notable examples of an internal register Both have been instrumental in stemming flight from the national flag to flags of convenience and in attracting foreignowned ships to the Norwegian and Danish flags Merchant shipA vessel that carries goods against payment of freight Commonly used to denote any nonmilitary ship but accurately restricted to commercial vessels only RegisterThe record of a ships ownership and nationality as listed with the maritime authorities of a country Also the compendium of such individual ships registrations Registration of a ship provides it with a nationality and makes it subject to the laws of the country in which registered the flag state regardless of the nationality of the ships ultimate owner Money figures All are expressed in contemporaneous US dollars unless otherwise indicated Net migration rate The balance between the number of persons entering and leaving a country during the year per  persons based on midyear population An excess of persons entering the country is referred to as net immigration  migrants population an excess of persons leaving the country as net emigration  migrants population Population Figures are estimates from the Bureau of the Census based on statistics from

Economic considerations however have played second fiddle to political and military upheavals including the nineyear Soviet military occupation ended  February  and the continuing bloody civil war

the Yugoslav economy For over  years the Stalinisttype economy has operated on the principles of central planning and state ownership of the means of production In recent years Albania has implemented limited economic reforms to stimulate its lagging economy provide incentives and decentralize decisionmaking In an effort to expand international ties Tirane has reestablished diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union and the US The Albanians have also passed legislation allowing foreign investment Albania possesses considerable mineral resources and until  was largely selfsufficient in food several years of drought have hindered agricultural development Numerical estimates of Albanian economic activity are subject to an especially wide margin of error because the government until

vertical arc toward the middle of the flag in the upper hoistside corner Economy Overview Beginning in late  the Chinese leadership has been trying to move the economy from the sluggish Sovietstyle centrally planned economy to a more productive and flexible economy with market elementsbut still within the framework of monolithic Communist control To this end the authorities have switched to a system of household responsibility in agriculture in place of the old collectivization increased the authority of local officials and plant managers in industry permitted a wide variety of smallscale enterprise in services and light manufacturing and opened the foreign economic sector to increased trade and joint ventures The most gratifying result has been a strong spurt in production particularly in agriculture in the early s Otherwise the leadership has often experienced in its hybrid system the worst results of socialism bureaucracy lassitude corruption and of capitalism windfall gains and steppedup inflation Beijing thus has periodically backtracked retightening central controls at intervals and thereby undermining the credibility of the reform process Popular

domestic consumption of milk and milk products and crops grown are primarily those for providing winter fodder Exports feature shipments of highgrade wool to the UK and the sale of postage stamps and coins Rich stocks of fish in the surrounding waters are not presently exploited by the islanders So far efforts to establish a domestic fishing industry have been unsuccessful In  the government began selling fishing licenses to foreign trawlers operating within the Falklands exclusive fishing zone These license fees amount to more than  million per year and are a primary source of income for the government To encourage tourism the Falkland Islands Development Corporation has built three lodges for visitors attracted by the abundant wildlife and trout fishing GDP NA per capita NA real growth

fishing industry and with an external debt twice the size of annual income When the nations of the world extended their fishing zones to  nautical miles in the early s the Faroese no longer could continue their traditional longdistance fishing and subsequently depleted their own nearby fishing areas one estimate foresaw a  drop in fish catch in  alone Half the fishing fleet is for sale and the

output nearly threefourths the US figure Its main economic force is the manufacturing sectorprincipally the wood metals and engineering industries Trade is important with the export of goods representing about  of GDP Except for timber and several minerals Finland depends on imported raw materials energy and some components of manufactured goods Because of the climate agricultural development is limited to maintaining selfsufficiency in basic commodities The economy which experienced an average of  annual growth between  and  leveled off in  and is now in a recession facing negative growth in  The clearing account system between Finland and the Soviet Union in the postwar periodmainly Soviet oil and gas for Finnish manufactured goodshad kept Finland isolated from world recessions the system however was dismantled on  January  in favor of hard currency trade As a result Finland must increase its competitiveness in certain sectors for example textiles foodstuffs paper

concerned parties Camp David further specifies that these negotiations will resolve the respective boundaries Pending the completion of this process it is US policy that the final status of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip has yet to be determined In the view of the US the term West Bank describes all of the area west of the Jordan under Jordanian administration before the  ArabIsraeli war With respect to negotiations envisaged in the framework agreement however it is US policy that a distinction must be made between Jerusalem and the rest of the West Bank because of the citys special status

economy and is a leading exporter It experienced fasterthanprojected real growth largely because of demand in eastern Germany for western German goods Western Germany has a highly urbanized and skilled population which enjoys excellent living standards abundant leisure time and comprehensive social welfare benefits Western Germany is relatively poor in natural resources coal being the most important mineral Western Germanys worldclass companies manufacture technologically advanced goods The regions economy is mature manufacturing and service industries account for the dominant share of economic activity and raw materials and semimanufactured products constitute a large proportion of imports In  manufacturing accounted for  of GDP with other sectors contributing lesser amounts In recent years gross fixed investment has accounted for about  of GDP In  GDP in the western region was an estimated  per capita In contrast eastern Germanys obsolete command economy once dominated by smokestack heavy industries has been undergoing a wrenching change to a market economy Industrial production in early  is down  from the same period last year due largely to the slump in domestic demand for eastern Germanmade goods and the ongoing economic restructuring The FRGs legal social welfare and economic systems have been extended to the east but economic restructuringprivatizing industry establishing clear property rights clarifying responsibility for environmental cleanup and removing Communistera holdovers from managementis proceeding slowly so far deterring outside investors The region is one of the worlds largest producers of lowgrade lignite coal but has few other resources The quality of statistics from eastern Germany remains poor Bonn is still trying to bring statistics for the region in line with West German practices The most challenging economic problem of a united Germany is the reconstruction of eastern Germanys economyspecifically finding the right mix of fiscal regulatory monetary and tax policies that will spur investment in the east without derailing western Germanys healthy economy or damaging relations with Western partners The biggest danger is that soaring unemployment in eastern Germany which could climb to the  to  range could touch off labor disputes or renewed mass relocation to western Germany and erode investor confidence in eastern Germany Overall economic activity grew an estimated  in western Germany in  while dropping roughly  in eastern Germany Per capita GDP in the eastern region was approximately  in

production and foreign trade while leaving some smallscale industry and services and most agriculture to private enterprise The economy has been dominated by the oil sector which has provided about  of foreign exchange earnings In the s financial problems caused by massive expenditures in the eightyear war with Iran and damage to oil export facilities by Iran led the government to implement austerity measures and to borrow heavily and later reschedule foreign debt payments After the end of hostilities in  oil exports gradually increased with the construction of new pipelines and restoration of damaged facilities Agricultural development remained hampered by labor shortages salinization and dislocations caused by previous land reform and collectivization programs The industrial sector although accorded high priority by the government also was under financial constraints Iraqs seizure of Kuwait in August  subsequent international economic embargoes and military

for crude oil food grains raw materials and military equipment Despite limited natural resources Israel has developed its agricultural and industrial sectors on an intensive scale over the past  years Industry accounts for about  of the labor force agriculture for  and services for most of the balance Diamonds hightechnology machinery and agricultural products fruits and vegetables are the biggest export earners The balance of payments has traditionally been negative but is offset by large transfer payments and foreign loans About half of Israels  billion external government debt is owed to the US which is its major source for economic and military aid To earn needed foreign exchange Israel must continue to exploit hightechnology niches in the international market such as medical scanning equipment Iraqs invasion of Kuwait on  August dealt a blow to Israels economy in  Higher world oil prices added an estimated  million to Israels  oil import bill and helped keep the inflation rate at

ceasefire established in October  between the domestic political groups generally held for about six years despite occasional fighting Syrian troops constituted as the Arab Deterrent Force by the Arab League have remained in Lebanon Syrias move toward supporting the Lebanese Muslims and the Palestinians and Israels growing support for Lebanese Christians brought the two sides into rough equilibrium but no progress was made toward national reconciliation or political reformsthe original cause of the war Continuing Israeli concern about the Palestinian presence in Lebanon led to the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in June  Israeli forces occupied all of the southern portion of the country and mounted a summerlong siege of Beirut which resulted in the evacuation of the PLO from Beirut in September under the supervision of a multinational force MNF made up of US French and Italian troops Within days of the departure of the MNF Lebanons newly elected president Bashir Gemayel was assassinated In the wake of his death Christian militiamen massacred hundreds of Palestinian refugees in two Beirut camps This prompted the return of the MNF to ease the security burden on Lebanons weak Army and security forces In late March  the last MNF units withdrew Lebanese Parliamentarians met in Taif Saudi Arabia in late  and concluded a national reconciliation pact that codified a new powersharing formula specifiying a Christian president but giving Muslims more authority Rene Muawad was subsequently elected president on  November  ending a month period during which Lebanon had no president and rival Muslim and Christian governments Muawad was assassinated  days later on  November on  November Ilyas Harawi was elected to succeed Muawad In October  the chances for ending the  year old civil war and implementing Taif were markedly improved when Syrian and Lebanese forces ousted renegade Christian General Awn from his stronghold in East Beirut Awn had defied the legitimate government and established a separate ministate within East Beirut after being appointed acting Prime Minister by outgoing President Gemayel in  Awn and his supporters feared Taif would diminish Christian power in Lebanon and increase the influence of Syria Since the removal of Awn the Lebanese Government has reunited the capital city and implemented a phased plan to disarm the militias and gradually reestablish authority throughout Lebanon The army has deployed from Beirut north along the coast road to Tripoli southeast into the Shuf mountains and south to the vicinity of Sidon Many militiamen from Christian and Muslim groups have evacuated Beirut for their strongholds in the north south and east of the country Some heavy weapons possessed by the militias have been turned over to the government which has begun a plan to integrate some militiamen into the military and the internal security forces Lebanon and Syria signed a treaty of friendship and cooperation in May  Lebanon continues to be partially occupied by Syrian troops which are deployed in East and West Beirut its southern suburbs the Bekaa Valley and throughout northern Lebanon Iran also maintains a small contingent of revolutionary guards in the Bekaa Valley and South Lebanon to support Lebanese Islamic fundamentalist groups Israel withdrew the bulk of its forces from the south in  although it still

increasing population sizable government deficits and heavy dependence on foreign aid In addition the economy must support a large military establishment and provide for the needs of  million Afghan refugees A real economic growth rate averaging  in recent years has enabled the country to cope with these problems Almost all agriculture and smallscale industry is in private hands and the government seeks to privatize a portion of the largescale industrial enterprises now publicly owned In December  Pakistan signed a threeyear economic reform agreement with the IMF which provides for a reduction in the government deficit and a liberalization of trade in return for further IMF financial support Late in  the IMF suspended assistance to Pakistan because the government failed to follow through on deficit reforms Pakistan almost certainly will make little headway on raising living standards for its rapidly expanding population at the current rate of growth population would double in

 Flag three equal vertical bands of blue hoist side yellow and red the national coat of arms that used to be centered in the yellow band has been removed now similar to the flags of Andorra and Chad Economy Overview Industry which accounts for onethird of the labor force and generates over half the GNP suffers from an aging capital plant and persistent shortages of energy The year  witnessed about a  drop in industrial production because of energy and input shortages and labor unrest In recent years the agricultural sector has had to contend with drought mismanagement and shortages of inputs A drought in  contributed to a lackluster harvest a problem compounded by corruption and a poor distribution system The new government is slowly loosening the tight central controls of Ceausescus command economy It has instituted moderate land reforms with close to onehalf of cropland now in private hands and it has allowed changes in prices for private agricultural output Also the new regime is permitting the establishment of private enterprises largely in services handicrafts and smallscale industry New laws providing for the privatization of large state firms have been passed However most of the early privatization will involve converting state firms into jointstock companies The selling of shares to the public has not yet been worked out Furthermore the government has halted the old policy of diverting food from domestic consumption to hard currency export markets So far the government does not seem willing to adopt a thoroughgoing market system that is there is great caution in decontrolling prices because of public opposition The government has sharply raised price ceilings instead of lifting them entirely GNP  billion per capita  real growth rate    est

Economy Overview Many of the white oneseventh of the South African population enjoy incomes material comforts and health and educational standards equal to those of Western Europe In contrast most of the remaining population suffers from the poverty patterns of the Third World including unemployment lack of job skills and barriers to movement into higherpaying fields Inputs and outputs thus do not move smoothly into the most productive employments and the effectiveness of the market is further lowered by international constraints on dealings with South Africa The main strength of the economy lies in its rich mineral resources which provide twothirds of exports Average growth of less than  in output in recent years falls far short of the  level needed to cut into the high unemployment rate

yellowedged fivepointed red star in the upper hoistside corner Economy Overview The first six years of perestroyka economic and political restructuring have undermined the institutions and processes of the Soviet command economy without replacing them with efficiently functioning markets The initial reforms have featured greater authority for enterprise managers over prices wages product mix investment sources of supply and customers But in the absence of effective market discipline the result has been the disappearance of lowprice goods excessive wage increases an even larger volume of unfinished construction projects and in general continued economic stagnation The Gorbachev regime has made at least four serious errors in economic policy in these six years the unpopular and shortlived antialcohol campaign the initial cutback in imports of consumer goods the failure to act decisively at the beginning for the privatization of agriculture and the buildup of a massive overhang of unspent rubles in the hands of households and enterprises The regime has vacillated among a series of ambitious economic policy prescriptions put forth by leading economists and political leaders The plans vary from proposals for a quick marketization of the economy b gradual marketization c a period of retrenchment to ensure a stable base for future marketization and d a return to disciplined central planning and allocation The economy caught between two systems is suffering from even greater mismatches between what is being produced and what would serve the best interests of enterprises and households Meanwhile the seething nationality problems have been dislocating regional patterns of economic specialization and pose a further major threat to growth prospects over the next few years Official Soviet statistics report GNP fell by  in  but the actual decline was substantially greater Whatever the numerical decline it does not capture the increasing disjointures in the economy evidenced by emptier shelves longer lines increased barter and widespread strikes GNP approximately  billion per capita  real growth rate   to    est based on a reconstruction of official Soviet statistics notebecause of the continued unraveling of Soviet economic and statistical controls the estimate is subject to even greater uncertainties than in earlier years the dollar estimates

figure is based on the application of CIAs usual estimating methods whereas the   figure is corrected for measurement problems that worsened sharply in  Inflation rate consumer prices   est

to the hoist side in the style of the Dannebrog Danish flag Economy Overview Aided by a long period of peace and neutrality during World War I through World War II Sweden has achieved an enviable standard of living under a mixed system of hightech capitalism and extensive welfare benefits It has essentially full employment a modern distribution system excellent internal and external communications and a skilled labor force Timber hydropower and iron ore constitute the resource base of an economy that is heavily oriented toward foreign trade Privately owned firms account for about  of industrial output of which the engineering sector accounts for  of output and exports For some observers the Swedish model has succeeded in making economic efficiency and social egalitarianism complementary rather than competitive goals Others argue that the Swedish model is on the verge of collapsing by pointing to the serious economic problems Sweden faces in  high inflation and absenteeism growing unemployment and deficits and declining international competitiveness In  to improve the economy the government approved a mandate for Sweden to seek EC membership and an austerity and privatization package and implemented a major tax reform These reforms may succeed in turning the economy around in  GDP  billion per capita  real growth rate   Inflation rate consumer prices

structured Bathist economy turned out slightly more goods in  than in  when the population was  smaller Economic difficulties are attributable in part to severe drought in several recent years costly but unsuccessful attempts to match Israels military strength a falloff in Arab aid and insufficient foreign exchange earnings to buy needed inputs for industry and agriculture Socialist policy embodied in a thicket of bureaucratic regulations in many instances has driven away or pushed underground the mercantile and entrepreneurial spirit for which Syrian businessmen have long been famous Two bright spots a sizable number of villagers have benefited from land redistribution electrification and other rural development programs and a recent find of light crude oil has enabled Syria to cut oil imports A longterm concern is the additional drain of upstream Euphrates water by Turkey when its vast dam and irrigation projects are completed toward the end of the s Output in  rebounded

the most important economic sector employing about  of the labor force accounting for almost  of GDP and contributing about  to exports Impressive growth in recent years has not solved all of the economic problems facing Turkey Inflation and interest rates remain high and a large budget deficit will continue to provide difficulties for a country undergoing a substantial transformation from a centrally controlled to a free market economy The government has launched a multimilliondollar development program in the southeastern region which includes the building of a dozen dams on the Tigris

production reaching  bd in  and expected to increase in the years ahead Following the end of the war in  heavyhanded government measures undermined efforts at an efficient merger of the agricultural resources of the south and the industrial resources of the north The economy remains heavily dependent on foreign aid and has received assistance from Communist countries Sweden and UN agencies

in June  ended with Israel in control of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip the Sinai and the Golan Heights As stated in the  Camp David Accords and reaffirmed by President Reagans  September  peace initiative the final status of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip their relationship with their neighbors and a peace treaty between Israel and Jordan are to be negotiated among the concerned parties Camp David further specifies that these negotiations will resolve the respective boundaries Pending the completion of this process it is US policy that the final status of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip has yet to be determined In the view of the US the term West Bank describes all of the area west of the Jordan River under Jordanian administration before the  ArabIsraeli war However with respect to negotiations envisaged in the framework agreement it is US policy that a distinction must be made between Jerusalem and the rest of the West Bank because of the citys special status and

military occupation and the effects of the Palestinian uprising Industries using advanced technology or requiring sizable financial resources have been discouraged by a lack of financial resources and Israeli policy Capital investment has largely gone into residential housing not into productive assets that could compete with Israeli industry A major share of GNP is derived from remittances of workers employed in Israel and neighboring Gulf states but remittances from the Gulf dropped dramatically in the wake of Iraqs invasion of Kuwait in August  Israeli reprisals against Palestinian unrest in the West Bank since  have pushed unemployment up and lowered living standards The Persian Gulf crisis of  also dealt a blow to the economy Many Palestinians returned from the Gulf
