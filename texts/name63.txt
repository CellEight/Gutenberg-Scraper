 The Number e Below is the value of e to about  places computed on the NCSA Cray YMP using the Brent multiple precision routines published as Algorithm  in the March  issue of Transactions on Mathematical Software The method used was to compute first the alternating series for e then to invert this result The time to compute e was about  seconds and the time to invert was about  seconds No special optimization was attempted on the code other than the default vectorization that the cft compiler attempts to do
