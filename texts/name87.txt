Transkei and Venda in South Africa Exchange rate The value of a nations monetary unit at a given date or over a given period of time as expressed in units of local currency per US dollar and as determined by international market forces or official fiat Gross domestic product GDP The value of all goods and services produced domestically in a given year Gross national product GNP The value of all goods and services produced domestically in a given year plus income earned abroad minus income earned by foreigners from domestic production Gross world product GWP The aggregate value of all goods and services produced worldwide in a given year GNPGDP methodology In the Economy section GNPGDP dollar estimates for the OECD countries the former Soviet republics and the East European countries are derived from purchasing power parity PPP calculations rather than from conversions at official currency exchange rates The PPP method normally involves the use of international dollar price weights which are applied to the quantities of goods and services produced in a given economy In addition to the lack of reliable data from the majority of countries the statistician faces a major difficulty in specifying identifying and allowing for the quality of goods and services The division of a PPP GNPGDP estimate in dollars by the corresponding estimate in the local currency gives the PPP conversion rate One thousand dollars will buy the same market basket of goods in the US as one thousand dollarsconverted to the local currency at the PPP conversion rate will buy in the other country GNPGDP estimates for the LDCs on the other hand are based on the conversion of GNPGDP estimates in local currencies to dollars at the official currency exchange rates Because currency exchange rates depend on a variety of international and domestic financial forces that often have little relation to domestic output use of these rates is less satisfactory for calculating GNPGDP than the PPP method Furthermore exchange rates may suddenly go up or down by  or more because of market forces or official fiat whereas real output has remained unchanged One additional caution the proportion of say defense expenditures as a percent of GNPGDP in local currency accounts may differ substantially from the proportion when GNPGDP accounts are expressed in PPP terms as for example when an observer estimates the dollar level of Russian or Japanese military expenditures similar problems exist when components are expressed in dollars under currency exchange rate procedures Finally as academic research moves forward on the PPP method we hope to convert all GNPGDP estimates to this method in future editions of The World Factbook Growth rate population The annual percent change in the population resulting from a surplus or deficit of births over deaths and the balance of migrants entering and leaving a country The rate may be positive or negative Illicit drugs There are five categories of illicit drugsnarcotics stimulants depressants sedatives hallucinogens and cannabis These categories include many drugs legally produced and prescribed by doctors as well as those

proximity of neighboring states may prevent some national claims from being extended the full distance Merchant marine All ships engaged in the carriage of goods All commercial vessels as opposed to all nonmilitary ships which excludes tugs fishing vessels offshore oil rigs etc also a grouping of merchant ships by nationality or register Captive registerA register of ships maintained by a territory possession or colony primarily or exclusively for the use of ships owned in the parent country also referred to as an offshore register the offshore equivalent of an internal register Ships on a captive register will fly the same flag as the parent country or a local variant of it but will be subject to the maritime laws and taxation rules of the offshore territory Although the nature of a captive register makes it especially desirable for ships owned in the parent country just as in the internal register the ships may also be owned abroad The captive register then acts as a flag of convenience register except that it is not the register of an independent state Flag of convenience registerA national register offering registration to a merchant ship not owned in the flag state The major flags of convenience FOC attract ships to their register by virtue of low fees low or nonexistent taxation of profits and liberal manning requirements True FOC registers are characterized by having relatively few of the ships registered actually owned in the flag state Thus while virtually any flag can be used for ships under a given set of circumstances an FOC register is one where the majority of the merchant fleet is owned abroad It is also referred to as an open register Flag stateThe nation in which a ship is registered and which holds legal jurisdiction over operation of the ship whether at home or abroad Differences in flag state maritime legislation determine how a ship is manned and taxed and whether a foreignowned ship may be placed on the register Internal registerA register of ships maintained as a subset of a national register Ships on the internal register fly the national flag and have that nationality but are subject to a separate set of maritime rules from those on the main national register These differences usually include lower taxation of profits manning by foreign nationals and usually ownership outside the flag state when it functions as an FOC register The Norwegian International Ship Register and Danish International Ship Register are the most notable examples of an internal register Both have been instrumental in stemming flight from the national flag to flags of convenience and in attracting foreignowned ships to the Norwegian and Danish flags Merchant shipA vessel that carries goods against payment of freight commonly used to denote any nonmilitary ship but accurately restricted to commercial vessels only RegisterThe record of a ships ownership and nationality as listed with the maritime authorities of a country also the compendium of such individual ships registrations Registration of a ship provides it with a nationality and makes it subject to the laws of the country in which registered the flag state regardless of the nationality of the ships ultimate owner Money figures All are expressed in contemporaneous US dollars unless otherwise indicated National product The total output of goods and services in a

Economy Overview Fundamentally Afghanistan is an extremely poor landlocked country highly dependent on farming wheat especially and livestock raising sheep and goats Economic considerations have played second fiddle to political and military upheavals during more than  years of war including the nearly year Soviet military occupation which ended  February  Over the past decade onethird of the population fled the country with Pakistan sheltering more than  million refugees and Iran about  million Another  million probably moved into and around urban areas within Afghanistan Although

levels and an unemployment rate estimated at  For over  years the Stalinisttype economy operated on the principle of central planning and state ownership of the means of production Fitful economic reforms begun during  including the liberalization of prices and trade the privatization of shops and transport and land reform were crippled by widespread civil disorder Following its overwhelming victory in the  March  elections the new Democratic government announced a program of shock therapy to stabilize the economy and establish a market economy In an effort to expand international ties Tirane has reestablished diplomatic relations with the major republics of the former Soviet Union and the US and has joined the IMF and the World Bank The Albanians have also passed legislation allowing foreign investment but not foreign ownership of real estate Albania possesses considerable mineral resources and until  was largely selfsufficient in food however the breakup of cooperative farms in  and general economic decline forced Albania to rely on foreign aid to maintain adequate supplies In  the government tightened budgetary contols leading to another drop in domestic output The

three equal horizontal bands of red top blue and gold Armenia Economy Overview Armenia under the old centrally planned Soviet system had built up textile machinebuilding and other industries and had become a key supplier to sister republics In turn Armenia had depended on supplies of raw materials and energy from the other republics Most of these supplies enter the republic by rail through Azerbaijan  and Georgia  The economy has been severely hurt by ethnic strife with Azerbaijan over control of the NagornoKarabakh Autonomous Oblast a mostly Armenianpopulated enclave within the national boundaries of Azerbaijan In addition to outright warfare the strife has included interdiction of Armenian imports on the Azerbaijani railroads and expensive airlifts of supplies to beleaguered Armenians in NagornoKarabakh An earthquake in December  destroyed about onetenth of industrial capacity and housing the repair of which has not been possible because the supply of funds and real resources has been disrupted by the reorganization and subsequent dismantling of the central USSR administrative apparatus Among facilities made unserviceable by the earthquake are the Yerevan nuclear power plant which had supplied  of Armenias needs for electric power and a plant that produced onequarter of the output of elevators in the former USSR Armenia has some deposits of nonferrous metal ores bauxite copper zinc and molybdenum that are largely unexploited For the midterm Armenias economic prospects seem particularly bleak because of ethnic strife and the unusually high dependence on outside areas themselves in a chaotic state of transformation The dramatic drop in output in  is attributable largely to the cumulative impact of the blockade of particular importance was the shutting off in the summer of  of rail and road links to Russia through Georgia due to civil strife in the latter republic National product GDP NA National product real growth rate

producer  to the other states Belarus had a significant share of the machinebuilding capacity of the former USSR It is especially noted for production of tractors large trucks machine tools and automation equipment The soil in Belarus is not as fertile as the black earth of Ukraine but by emphasizing favorable crops and livestock especially pigs and chickens Belarus has become a net exporter to the other former republics of meat milk eggs flour and potatoes Belarus produces only small amounts of oil and gas and receives most of its fuel from Russia through the Druzhba oil pipeline and the Northern Lights gas pipeline These pipelines transit Belarus en route to Eastern Europe Belarus produces petrochemicals plastics synthetic fibers nearly  of former Soviet output and fertilizer  of former Soviet output Raw material resources are limited to potash and peat deposits The peat more than onethird of the total for the former Soviet Union is used in domestic heating as boiler fuel for electric power stations and in the production of chemicals The potash supports fertilizer production In  GDP fell an estimated  largely because the country is highly dependent on the ailing Russian

Overview The economy with large agrarian mining and manufacturing sectors entered the s with declining real growth runaway inflation an unserviceable foreign debt of  billion and a lack of policy direction In addition the economy remained highly regulated inwardlooking and protected by substantial trade and investment barriers Ownership of major industrial and mining facilities is divided among private interests  including several multinationals  and the government Most large agricultural holdings are private with the government channeling financing to this sector Conflicts between large landholders and landless peasants have produced intermittent violence The COLLOR government which assumed office in March  launched an ambitious reform program that sought to modernize and reinvigorate the economy by stabilizing prices deregulating the economy and opening it to increased foreign competition The government also obtained an IMF standby loan in January  and reached agreements with commercial bankers on the repayment of interest arrears and on the reduction of debt and debt service payments Galloping inflation  the rate doubled in   continues to undermine

leadership has been trying to move the economy from the sluggish Sovietstyle centrally planned economy to a more productive and flexible economy with market elements but still within the framework of monolithic Communist control To this end the authorities have switched to a system of household responsibility in agriculture in place of the old collectivization increased the authority of local officials and plant managers in industry permitted a wide variety of smallscale enterprise in services and light manufacturing and opened the foreign economic sector to increased trade and joint ventures The most gratifying result has been a strong spurt in production particularly in agriculture in the early s Industry also has posted major gains especially in coastal areas near Hong Kong and opposite Taiwan where foreign investment and modern production methods have helped spur production of both domestic and export goods Aggregate output has more than doubled since  On the darker side the leadership has often experienced in its hybrid system the worst results of socialism bureaucracy lassitude corruption and of capitalism windfall gains and steppedup inflation Beijing thus has periodically backtracked retightening central controls at intervals and thereby lessening the credibility of the reform process In  and again in  output rose substantially particularly in the favored coastal areas Popular resistance changes in central policy and loss of authority by rural cadres have weakened Chinas population control program which is essential to the nations longterm economic

overstaffing A reform program supported by the IMF and World Bank ran into difficulties in  because of problems in changing to a democratic political regime and a heavy debtservicing burden Oil has supplanted forestry as the mainstay of the economy providing about twothirds of government revenues and exports In the early s rapidly rising oil revenues enabled Congo to finance largescale

refugee population both Croatian and Bosnian and the disruption of economic ties to Serbia and the other former Yugoslav republics as well as within its own territory At the minimum extensive Western aid and investment especially in the tourist and oil industries would seem necessary to salvage a desperate economic situation However peace and political stability must come first As of June

Soviet style of government ownership of substantially all the means of production and government planning of all but the smallest details of economic activity Thus Cuba like the former Warsaw Pact nations has remained in the backwater of economic modernization The economy contracted by about onethird between  and  as it absorbed the loss of  billion of annual economic aid from the former Soviet Union and much smaller amounts from Eastern Europe The government implemented numerous energy conservation measures and import substitution schemes to cope with a large decline in imports To reduce fuel consumption Havana has cut back bus service and imported approximately  million bicycles from China domesticated nearly  oxen to replace tractors and halted a large amount of industrial production The government has prioritized domestic food production and promoted herbal medicines since  to compensate for lower imports Havana also has been shifting its trade away from the former

holds back technical modernization and foreign investment Even so the economy grew rapidly during the late s and early s but in  the collapse of world oil prices and an increasingly heavy burden of debt servicing led Egypt to begin negotiations with the IMF for balanceofpayments support Egypts first IMF standby arrangement concluded in mid was suspended in early  because of the governments failure to adopt promised reforms Egypt signed a followon program with the IMF and also negotiated a structural adjustment loan with the World Bank in  In  the government made solid progress on administrative reforms such as liberalizing exchange and interest rates but resisted implementing major structural reforms like streamlining the public sector As a result the economy has not gained momentum and unemployment has become a growing problem In  tourism has plunged  or so because of sporadic attacks by Islamic extremists on tourist groups President MUBARAK has cited population growth

restaurants were sold to private owners The auctioning of largescale enterprises is progressing with the proceeds being held in escrow until the prior ownership that is Estonian or the Commonwealth of Independent States can be established Estonia ranks first in per capita consumption among the former Soviet republics Agriculture is well developed especially meat production and provides a surplus for export Only about onefifth of the work force is in agriculture The major share of the work force engages in manufacturing both capital and consumer goods based on raw materials and intermediate products from the other former Soviet republics These manufactures are of high quality by exSoviet standards and are exported to the other republics Estonias mineral resources are limited to major deposits of shale oil  of the old Soviet total and phosphorites  million tons Estonia has a large relatively modern port and produces more than half of its own energy needs at highly polluting shale oil power plants It has advantages in the transition not having suffered so long under the Soviet yoke and having better chances of developing profitable ties to the Nordic and West European countries

Islas Malvinas Economy Overview The economy is based on sheep farming which directly or indirectly employs most of the work force A few dairy herds are kept to meet domestic consumption of milk and milk products and crops grown are primarily those for providing winter fodder Exports feature shipments of highgrade wool to the UK and the sale of postage stamps and coins Rich stocks of fish in the surrounding waters are not presently exploited by the islanders So far efforts to establish a domestic fishing industry have been unsuccessful In  the government began selling fishing licenses to foreign trawlers operating within the Falklands exclusive fishing zone These license fees amount to more than  million per year and are a primary source of income for the government To encourage

Overview Finland has a highly industrialized largely free market economy with per capita output twothirds of the US figure Its key economic sector is manufacturing  principally the wood metals and engineering industries Trade is important with the export of goods representing about  of GDP Except for timber and several minerals Finland depends on imports of raw materials energy and some components for manufactured goods Because of the climate agricultural development is limited to maintaining selfsufficiency in basic products The economy which experienced an average of  annual growth between  and  sank into deep recession in  as growth contracted by  The recession  which continued in  with growth contracting by   has been caused by economic overheating depressed foreign markets and the dismantling of the barter system between Finland and the former Soviet Union under which Soviet oil and gas had been exchanged for Finnish manufactured goods The Finnish Government has proposed efforts to increase industrial competitiveness and efficiency by an increase in exports to Western markets cuts in public expenditures partial privatization of state enterprises and changes in monetary policy In June  Helsinki had tied the markka to the ECs European Currency Unit ECU to promote stability Ongoing speculation resulting from a lack of confidence in the governments policies forced Helsinki to devalue the markka by about  in November  and to indefinitely break the link in September  By boosting the competitiveness of Finnish exports these measures presumably have kept the economic downturn from being even more severe Unemployment probably will remain a serious problem during the next few years  monthly figures in early  are approaching   with the majority of Finnish firms facing a weak domestic market and the troubled German and Swedish export markets Declining revenues increased transfer payments and extensive funding to bail out the banking system are expected

accounted for about  of GDP  of export earnings and  of government revenues on average The high oil prices of the early s contributed to a substantial increase in per capita national income stimulated domestic demand reinforced migration from rural to urban areas and raised the level of real wages to among the highest in SubSaharan Africa The subsequent slide of Gabons economy which began with falling oil prices in  was reversed in  but debt servicing obligations continue to limit prospects for further domestic development Real growth in  was weak because of a combination of an overstaffed

are to be negotiated among the concerned parties Camp David further specifies that these negotiations will resolve the respective boundaries Pending the completion of this process it is US policy that the final status of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip has yet to be determined In the US view the term West Bank describes all of the area west of the Jordan River under Jordanian administration before the  ArabIsraeli war With respect to negotiations envisaged in the framework agreement however it is US policy that a distinction must be made between Jerusalem and the rest of the West Bank because of the citys special status and circumstances Therefore a negotiated solution for the final status of Jerusalem could be different in character from that of the rest of the West Bank Gaza Strip

red and yellow Germany Economy Overview With the collapse of communism in Eastern Europe in  prospects seemed bright for a fairly rapid incorporation of East Germany into the highly successful West German economy The Federal Republic however continues to experience difficulties in integrating and modernizing eastern Germany and the tremendous costs of unification have sunk western Germany deeper into recession The western German economy grew by less than  in  as the Bundesbank set high interest rates to offset the inflationary effects of large government deficits and high wage settlements Eastern Germany grew by  in  but this was from a shrunken base Despite government transfers to the east amounting to nearly  billion annually a selfsustaining economy in the region is still some years away The bright spots are eastern Germanys construction transportation telecommunications and service sectors which have experienced strong growth Western Germany has an advanced market economy and is a world leader in exports It has a highly urbanized and skilled population that enjoys excellent living standards abundant leisure time and comprehensive social welfare benefits Western Germany is relatively poor in natural resources coal being the most important mineral Western Germanys worldclass companies manufacture technologically advanced goods The regions economy is mature services and manufacturing account for the dominant share of economic activity and raw materials and semimanufactured goods constitute a large portion of imports In recent years manufacturing has accounted for about  of GDP with other sectors contributing lesser amounts Gross fixed investment in  accounted for about  of GDP GDP in the western region is now  per capita or  of US per capita GDP Eastern Germanys economy appears to be changing from one anchored on manufacturing into a more serviceoriented economy The German government however is intent on maintaining a manufacturing base in the east and is considering a policy for subsidizing industrial cores in the region Eastern Germanys share of allGerman GDP is only  and eastern productivity is just  that of the west even though eastern wages are at roughly  of western levels The privatization agency for eastern Germany Treuhand has privatized more than fourfifths of the almost  firms under its control and will likely wind down operations in  Private investment in the region continues to be lackluster resulting primarily from the deepening recession in western Germany and excessively high eastern wages Eastern Germany has one of the worlds largest reserves of lowgrade lignite coal but little else in the way of mineral resources The quality of statistics from eastern Germany is improving yet many gaps remain the federal government began producing allGerman data for select economic statistics at the start of  The most challenging economic problem is promoting eastern Germanys economic reconstruction  specifically finding the right mix of fiscal monetary regulatory and tax policies that will spur investment in eastern Germany  without destabilizing western Germanys economy or damaging relations with West European partners The government hopes a solidarity pact among labor unions business state governments and the SPD opposition will provide the right mix of wage restraints investment incentives and spending cuts to stimulate eastern recovery Finally the homogeneity of the German economic culture has been changed by the admission of large numbers of immigrants National product Germany GDP  purchasing power

assistance package from the EC under the strictest terms yet imposed on a member country as the EC finally ran out of patience with Greeces failure to put its financial affairs in order On the advice

is a mixed economy with many socialist institutions and central planning but with a recent emphasis on deregulation and private enterprise Indonesia has extensive natural wealth yet with a large and rapidly increasing population it remains a poor country Real GDP growth in  averaged about  quite impressive but not sufficient to both slash underemployment and absorb the  million workers annually entering the labor force Agriculture including forestry and fishing is an important sector accounting for almost  of GDP and over  of the labor force The staple crop is rice Once the worlds largest rice importer Indonesia is now nearly selfsufficient Plantation crops  rubber and palm oil  and textiles and plywood are being encouraged for both export and job generation Industrial output now accounts for almost  of GDP and is based on a supply of diverse natural resources including crude oil natural gas timber metals and coal Of these the oil sector dominates the external economy generating more than  of the governments revenues and  of export earnings in  However the economys growth is highly dependent on the continuing expansion of nonoil exports Japan remains Indonesias most important customer and supplier of aid Rapid growth in the money supply in  prompted Jakarta to implement a tight monetary policy in  forcing the private sector to go to foreign banks for investment financing Real interest rates remained above  and offshore commercial debt grew The growth in offshore debt prompted Jakarta to limit foreign borrowing beginning in late  Despite the

engages in extensive central planning and management of industrial production and foreign trade while leaving some smallscale industry and services and most agriculture to private enterprise The economy has been dominated by the oil sector which has traditionally provided about  of foreign exchange earnings In the s financial problems caused by massive expenditures in the eightyear war with Iran and damage to oil export facilities by Iran led the government to implement austerity measures and to borrow heavily and later reschedule foreign debt payments After the end of hostilities in  oil exports gradually increased with the construction of new pipelines and restoration of damaged facilities Agricultural development remained hampered by labor shortages salinization and dislocations caused by previous land reform and collectivization programs The industrial sector although accorded high priority by the government also was under financial constraints Iraqs seizure of Kuwait in August  subsequent international economic embargoes and military action by an international coalition beginning in January  drastically changed the economic picture Industrial and transportation facilities suffered severe damage and have been only partially restored Oil exports remain at less than  of the previous level Shortages of spare parts continue Living standards deteriorated even further in  and early  consumer prices at least tripled in  The UNsponsored economic embargo has reduced exports and imports and has contributed to the sharp rise in prices The governments policies of supporting large military and internal security forces and of allocating resources to key supporters of the regime have exacerbated shortages In brief per capita output in early  is far below the

Ireland Economy Overview The economy is small and trade dependent Agriculture once the most important sector is now dwarfed by industry which accounts for  of GDP about  of exports and employs  of the labor force Since  real GDP growth led by exports has averaged  annually Over the same period inflation has fallen sharply and chronic trade deficits have been transformed into annual surpluses Unemployment at  remains a serious problem however and job creation is the main focus of government policy To ease unemployment Dublin aggressively courts foreign investors and recently created a new industrial development agency to aid small indigenous firms Government assistance is constrained by Dublins continuing deficit reduction measures After five years of fiscal restraint total government debt still exceeds GDP Growth probably will moderate in  as the heavily indebted and tradedependent economy is highly sensitive to changes in exchange rates and world interest rates Exports to the UK

both Arab aid and worker remittances slowed economic growth to an average of roughly  per year Imports  mainly oil capital goods consumer durables and food  have been outstripping exports with the difference covered by aid remittances and borrowing In mid the Jordanian Government began debtrescheduling negotiations and agreed to implement an IMF program designed to gradually reduce the budget deficit and implement badly needed structural reforms The Persian Gulf crisis that began in August  however aggravated Jordans already serious economic problems forcing the government to shelve the IMF program stop most debt payments and suspend rescheduling negotiations Aid from Gulf Arab states and worker remittances have plunged and refugees have flooded the country straining government

privatization of shops and farms has begun Latvia lacks natural resources aside from its arable land and small forests Its most valuable economic asset is its work force which is better educated and disciplined than in most of the former Soviet republics Industrial production is highly diversified with products ranging from agricultural machinery to consumer electronics One conspicuous vulnerability Latvia produces only  of its electric power needs Latvia in the near term must retain key commercial ties to Russia Belarus and Ukraine while moving in the long run toward joint ventures with technological support from and trade ties to the West Because of the efficiency of its mostly individual farms Latvians enjoy a diet that is higher in meat vegetables and dairy products and lower in grain and potatoes than diets in the  nonBaltic republics of the former USSR Good relations with Russia are threatened by animosity between ethnic Russians  of the population and native Latvians

October  Under the Taif accord  the blueprint for national reconciliation  the Lebanese have established a more equitable political system particularly by giving Muslims a greater say in the political process Since December  the Lebanese have formed three cabinets and conducted the first legislative election in  years Most of the militias have been weakened or disbanded The Lebanese Armed Forces LAF has seized vast quantities of weapons used by the militias during the war and extended central government authority over about onehalf of the country Hizballah the radical Shia party is the only

troops in Lebanon These troops are based mainly in Beirut North Lebanon and the Bekaa Valley Syrias deployment was legitimized by the Arab League early in Lebanons civil war and in the Taif accord

socialistoriented economy depends primarily upon revenues from the oil sector which contributes practically all export earnings and about onethird of GDP In  per capita GDP was the highest in Africa at  but GDP growth rates have slowed and fluctuate sharply in response to changes in the world oil market Import restrictions and inefficient resource allocations have led to shortages of basic goods and foodstuffs although the reopening of the LibyanTunisian border in April  and the LibyanEgyptian border in December  have eased shortages Austerity budgets and a lack of trained technicians have undermined the governments ability to implement a number of planned infrastructure development projects Windfall revenues from the hike in world oil prices in late  improved the foreign payments position and resulted in a current account surplus for the first time in five years The nonoil manufacturing and construction sectors which account for about  of GDP have expanded from processing mostly agricultural products to include petrochemicals iron steel and aluminum Although agriculture accounts for only  of GDP it employs about  of the labor force Climatic conditions and poor soils

the old USSR Lithuania historically lagged behind Latvia and Estonia in economic development The country has no important natural resources aside from its arable land and strategic location Industry depends entirely on imported materials that have come from the republics of the former USSR Lithuania benefits from its icefree port at Klaipeda on the Baltic Sea and its rail and highway hub at Vilnius which provides land communication between Eastern Europe and Russia Latvia Estonia and Belarus Industry produces a small assortment of highquality products ranging from complex machine tools to sophisticated consumer electronics Because of nuclear power Lithuania is presently selfsufficient in electricity exporting its surplus to Latvia and Belarus the nuclear facilities inherited from the USSR however have come under world scrutiny as seriously deficient in safety standards Agriculture is efficient compared with most of the former Soviet Union Lithuania held first place in per capita consumption of meat second place for eggs and potatoes and fourth place for milk and dairy products Grain must be imported to support the meat and dairy industries Lithuania is pressing ahead with plans to privatize at least  of stateowned property industry agriculture and housing having already sold almost all housing and many small enterprises using a voucher system Other government priorities include encouraging foreign investment by protecting the property rights of foreign firms and redirecting foreign trade away from Eastern markets to the more competitive Western markets For the moment Lithuania will remain highly dependent on Russia for energy raw materials grains and markets for its products In  output plummeted by  because of cumulative problems with inputs and with

world In recent years extensive mineral resources have been developed with Soviet support The mining and processing of coal copper molybdenum tin tungsten and gold account for a large part of industrial production Timber and fishing are also important sectors In  the Mongolian leadership continued its struggle with severe economic dislocations mainly attributable to the crumbling of the USSR by far Mongolias leading trade and development partner Moscow cut almost all aid in  and little was provided in  Industry in  was hit hard by energy shortages mainly due to disruptions in coal production and shortfalls in petroleum imports By the end of the year the country was perilously close to a complete shutdown of its centralized energy supply system due to critical coal shortages The

involving a combination of free market activity and government intervention The government controls key areas such as the vital petroleum sector through largescale state enterprises and extensively subsidizes agriculture fishing and areas with sparse resources Norway also maintains an extensive welfare system that helps propel public sector expenditures to slightly more than  of the GDP and results in one of the highest average tax burdens in the world  A small country with a high dependence on international trade Norway is basically an exporter of raw materials and semiprocessed goods with an abundance of small and mediumsized firms and is ranked among the major shipping nations The country is richly endowed with natural resources  petroleum hydropower fish forests and minerals  and is highly dependent on its oil sector to keep its economy afloat Although one of the governments main priorities is to reduce this dependency this situation is not likely to improve for years to come The government also hopes to reduce unemployment and strengthen and diversify the economy through tax reform and a series of expansionary budgets The budget deficit is expected to hit a record  of GDP because of welfare spending and bailouts of the banking system Unemployment continues at record levels of over   including those in job programs  because of the weakness of the economy outside the oil sector Overall economic growth is expected to be around  in  while inflation is likely to rise slightly to  Oslo a member of the European Free Trade Area has applied for EC membership and

sizable government deficits and heavy dependence on foreign aid In addition the economy must support a large military establishment A real economic growth rate averaging  in recent years has helped

exports The government has been pushing the development of a tourist industry to relieve high unemployment which recently amounted to onethird of the labor force The gap in Reunion between the welloff and the poor is extraordinary and accounts for the persistent social tensions The white and Indian communities are substantially better off than other segments of the population often approaching European standards whereas indigenous groups suffer the poverty and unemployment typical of the poorer nations of the African continent The outbreak of severe rioting in February  illustrates the seriousness of socioeconomic tensions The economic wellbeing of Reunion depends heavily on continued financial assistance from France National product GDP  exchange rate conversion   billion  est

capital plant and persistent shortages of energy The year  witnessed a  drop in industrial production because of energy and input shortages and labor unrest In recent years the agricultural sector has had to contend with flooding mismanagement shortages of inputs and disarray caused by the dismantling of cooperatives A shortage of inputs and a severe drought in  contributed to a poor harvest a problem compounded by corruption and an obsolete distribution system The new government has instituted moderate land reforms with more than onehalf of cropland now in private hands and it has liberalized private agricultural output Private enterprises form an increasingly important portion of the economy largely in services handicrafts and smallscale industry Little progress on large scale privatization has been made since a law providing for the privatization of large state firms was passed in August  Most of the large state firms have been converted into jointstock companies but the selling of shares and assets to private owners has been delayed While the government has halted the old policy of diverting food from domestic consumption to hard currency export markets supplies remain scarce in some areas The new government continues to impose price ceilings on key consumer items In  the economy muddled along toward the new more open system yet output and living standards

continues to experience great difficulties in moving from its old centrally planned economy to a modern market economy President YELTSINs government made significant strides toward a market economy in  by freeing most prices slashing defense spending unifying foreign exchange rates and launching an ambitious privatization program At the same time GDP fell  according to official statistics largely reflecting government efforts to restructure the economy shortages of essential imports caused by the breakdown in former Bloc and interstate trade and reduced demand following the freeing of prices in January The actual decline however may have been less steep because industrial and agricultural enterprises had strong incentives to understate output to avoid taxes and official statistics may not have fully captured the output of the growing private sector Despite the large drop in output unemployment at yearend stood at an estimated  of Russias millionperson labor force many people however are working shortened weeks or are on forced leave Moscows financial stabilization program got off to a good start at the beginning of  but began to falter by midyear Under pressure from industrialists and the Supreme Soviet the government loosened fiscal policies in the second half In addition the Russian Central Bank relaxed its tight credit policy in July at the behest of new Acting Chairman Viktor GERASHCHENKO This loosening of financial policies led to a sharp increase in prices during the last quarter and inflation reached about  per month by yearend The situation of most consumers worsened in  The January price liberalization and a blossoming of private vendors filled shelves across the country with previously scarce food items and consumer goods but wages lagged behind inflation making such goods unaffordable for many consumers Falling real wages forced most Russians to spend a larger share of their income on food and to alter their eating habits Indeed many Russians reduced their consumption of higher priced meat fish milk vegetables and fruit in favor of more bread and potatoes As a result of higher spending on food consumers reduced their consumption of nonfood goods and services Despite a slow start and some rough going the Russian government by the end of  scored some successes in its campaign to break the states stranglehold on property and improve the environment for private businesses More peasant farms were created than expected the number of consumers purchasing goods from private traders rose sharply the portion of the population working in the private sector increased to nearly onefifth and the ninemonthlong slump in the privatization of small businesses was ended in the fall Although the output of weapons fell sharply in  most defense enterprises continued to encounter numerous difficulties developing and marketing consumer products establishing new supply links and securing resources for retooling Indeed total civil production by the defense sector fell in  because of shortages of inputs and lower consumer demand caused by higher prices Ruptured ties with former trading partners output declines and sometimes erratic efforts to move to world prices and decentralize trade  foreign and interstate  took a heavy toll on Russias commercial relations with other countries For the second year in a row foreign trade was down sharply with exports falling by as much as  and imports by  The drop in imports would have been much greater if foreign aid  worth an estimated  billion  had not allowed the continued inflow of essential products Trade with the other former Soviet republics continued to decline and support for the ruble as a common currency eroded in the face of Moscows loose monetary policies and rapidly rising prices throughout the region At the same time Russia paid only a fraction of the  billion due on the former USSRs roughly  billion debt debt rescheduling remained hung up because of a dispute between Russia and Ukraine over division of the former USSRs assets Capital flight also remained a serious problem in  Russias economic difficulties did not Russia Economy abate in the first

republic boundaries and the breakup of important interrepublic trade flows The situation in Serbia and Montenegro remains fluid in view of the extensive political and military strife Serbia and Montenegro faces major economic problems First like the other former Yugoslav republics it depended on its sister republics for large amounts of foodstuffs energy supplies and manufactures Wide varieties in climate mineral resources and levels of technology among the republics accentuate this interdependence as did the Communist practice of concentrating much industrial output in a small number of giant plants The breakup of many of the trade links the sharp drop in output as industrial plants lost suppliers and markets and the destruction of physical assets in the fighting all have contributed to the economic difficulties of the republics One singular factor in the economic situation of Serbia and Montenegro is the continuation in office of a Communist government that is primarily interested in political and military mastery not economic reform A further complication is the imposition of economic sanctions by the UN National product GDP  exchange rate conversion

Economic activity slowed early in  primarily as a result of slackened demand in Singapores export markets But after bottoming out in the second quarter the economy picked up in line with a gradual recovery in the United States The years best performers were the construction and financial services industries and manufacturers of computerrelated components Rising labor costs continue to be a threat to Singapores competitiveness but there are indications that productivity is catching up Government surpluses and the rate of gross national savings remain high In technology per capita output

complicated the task of moving toward a more open and decentralized economy The old Czechoslovakia even though highly industrialized by East European standards suffered from an aging capital plant lagging technology and a deficiency in energy and many raw materials In January  approximately one year after the end of communist control of Eastern Europe the Czech and Slovak Federal Republic launched a sweeping program to convert its almost entirely stateowned and controlled economy to a market system In  these measures resulted in privatization of some medium and smallscale economic activity and the setting of more than  of prices by the market  but at a cost in inflation unemployment and lower output For Czechoslovakia as a whole inflation in  was roughly  and output fell  In  in Slovakia inflation slowed to an estimated  and the estimated fall in GDP was a more moderate  In  the government anticipates up to a  drop in GDP with the disruptions from the separation from the Czech lands probably accounting for half the decline inflation according to government projections may rise to  and unemployment may reach  The Slovak government is moving ahead less enthusiastically than the Czech government in the further dismantling of the old centrally controlled economic system Although the governments of Slovakia and the Czech Republic had envisaged retaining the koruna as a common currency at least in the short run the two countries ended the currency union in February  National product GDP  purchasing power equivalent   billion  est National product real growth rate

below the levels in neighboring Austria and Italy Because of its strong ties to Western Europe and the small scale of damage during its fight for independence from Yugoslavia Slovenia has the brightest prospects among the former Yugoslav republics for economic recovery over the next few years The dissolution of Yugoslavia however has led to severe shortterm dislocations in production employment and trade ties For example overall industrial production fell  in  particularly hard hit were the iron and steel machinebuilding chemical and textile industries Meanwhile the continued fighting in other former Yugoslavian republics has led to further destruction of longestablished trade channels and to an influx of tens of thousands of Croatian and Bosnian refugees The key program for breaking up and privatizing major industrial firms was established in late  Bright spots for encouraging Western investors are Slovenias comparatively welleducated work force its developed infrastructure and its Western business attitudes but instability in Croatia is a deterrent Slovenia in absolute terms is a small economy and a little Western investment would go a long way National

Economy Overview After an impressive economic performance through most of the s Turkey has experienced erratic rates of economic growth since   ranging from a high of  in  to a low of  in  Strong consumer demand and increased public investment led the way to a strong  growth in  Chronic high inflation is Turkeys most serious economic problem leading to high interest rates and the rapid depreciation of the Turkish lira The huge public sector deficit  about  of GDP  and the Treasurys heavy reliance on Central Bank financing of the deficit are the major causes of Turkish inflation Meanwhile wage increases in both the public and private sector have outpaced productivity gains limited the governments ability to reduce current expenditures and hindered the return to profitability of many private companies Agriculture remains an important economic sector employing about half of the work force contributing  to GDP and accounting for about  of exports The government has launched a multibilliondollar development program in the southeastern region which includes the building of a dozen dams on the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers to generate electric power and irrigate large tracts of farmland The Turkish economy will probably continue to grow faster than the West European average in  but the shaky coalition government of Prime Minister DEMIREL  which has seen its parliamentary majority shrink from  to  seats during its first year in power  is unlikely to risk further erosion of its support by implementing the belttightening measures necessary to substantially reduce

output of the nextranking republic Its fertile black soil generated more than one fourth of Soviet agricultural output and its farms provided substantial quantities of meat milk grain and vegetables to other republics Likewise its welldeveloped and diversified heavy industry supplied equipment and raw materials to industrial and mining sites in other regions of the former USSR In  the Ukrainian government liberalized most prices and erected a legal framework for privatizing state enterprises while retaining many central economic controls and continuing subsidies to state production enterprises In November  the new Prime Minister KUCHMA launched a new economic reform program promising more freedom to the agricultural sector faster privatization of small and medium enterprises and stricter control over state subsidies Even so the magnitude of the problems and the slow pace in building new marketoriented institutions preclude a nearterm recovery of output to the  level National

produced twothirds of the USSRs cotton and ranks as the fourth largest global producer Moscows push for everincreasing amounts of cotton had included massive irrigation projects which caused extensive environmental damage to the Aral Sea and rivers of the republic Furthermore the lavish use of chemical fertilizers has caused extensive pollution and widespread health problems Recently the republic has sought to encourage food production at the expense of cotton The small industrial sector specializes in such items as agricultural machinery mineral fertilizers vegetable oil and bridge cranes Uzbekistan also has some important natural resources including gold about  of former Soviet production uranium and natural gas The Uzbek Government has encouraged some land reform but has shied away from other aspects of economic reform Output and living standards continued to fall in  largely because of the cumulative impact of disruptions in supply that have followed the dismemberment of the

Flag red with a large yellow fivepointed star in the center Vietnam Economy Overview Vietnam has made significant progress in recent years moving away from the planned economic model and toward a more effective marketbased economic system Most prices are now fully decontrolled and the Vietnamese currency has been effectively devalued and floated at world market rates In addition the scope for private sector activity has been expanded primarily through decollectivization of the agricultural sector and introduction of laws giving legal recognition to private business Despite such positive indicators the countrys economic turnaround remains tenuous Nearly threequarters of export earnings are generated by only two commodities rice and crude oil Meanwhile industrial production stagnates burdened by uncompetitive stateowned enterprises the government is unwilling or unable to privatize Unemployment looms as the most serious problem with over  of the workforce without jobs and

postGulf crisis peace initiative the final status of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip their relationship with their neighbors and a peace treaty between Israel and Jordan are to be negotiated among the concerned parties Camp David further specifies that these negotiations will resolve the respective boundaries Pending the completion of this process it is US policy that the final status of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip has yet to be determined In the view of the US the term West Bank describes all of the area west of the Jordan River under Jordanian administration before the  ArabIsraeli war However with respect to negotiations envisaged in the framework agreement it is US policy that a distinction must be made between Jerusalem and the rest of the West Bank because of the citys special status and circumstances Therefore a negotiated solution for the final status of Jerusalem could be different in character from that of the rest of the West Bank West Bank Geography Location

Names conventional long form none conventional short form West Bank Digraph WG West Bank Economy Overview Economic progress in the West Bank has been hampered by Israeli military administration and the effects of the Palestinian uprising intifadah Industries using advanced technology or requiring sizable investment have been discouraged by a lack of local capital and restrictive Israeli policies Capital investment consists largely of residential housing not productive assets that would enable local firms to compete with Israeli industry A major share of GNP is derived from remittances of workers employed in Israel and Persian Gulf states but such transfers from the Gulf dropped dramatically after Iraq invaded Kuwait in August  In the wake of the Persian Gulf crisis many Palestinians have returned to the West Bank increasing unemployment and export revenues have plunged because of the loss of markets in Jordan and the Gulf states Israeli measures to curtail the intifadah also have pushed unemployment up and lowered living standards The areas economic outlook remains bleak National product GNP  exchange rate conversion   billion  est National product real growth rate   est
