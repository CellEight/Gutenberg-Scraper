Transkei and Venda in South Africa Gross domestic product GDP The value of all goods and services produced domestically Gross national product GNP The value of all goods and services produced domestically plus income earned abroad minus income earned by foreigners from domestic production GNPGDP methodology GNPGDP dollar estimates for the OECD countries the USSR Eastern Europe and a portion of the developing countries are derived from purchasing power parity PPP calculations rather than from conversions at official currency exchange rates The PPP methods involve the use of average price weights which lie between the weights of the domestic and foreign price systems using these weights US  converted into German marks by a PPP method will buy an equal amount of goods and services in both the US and Germany One caution the proportion of say military expenditures as a percent of GNPGDP in local currency accounts may differ substantially from the proportion when GNPGDP is expressed in PPP dollar terms as for example when an observer estimates the dollar level of Soviet or Japanese military expenditures Similarly dollar figures for exports and imports reflect the price patterns of international markets rather than PPP price patterns Growth rate population The annual percent change in the population resulting from a surplus or deficit of births over deaths and the balance of migrants entering and leaving a country The rate may be positive or negative Illicit drugs There are five categories of illicit drugsnarcotics stimulants depressants sedatives

forage crops forest and woodlandland under dense or open stands of trees and otherany land type not specifically mentioned above urban areas roads desert The percentage figure for irrigated refers to the portion of the entire amount of land area that is artificially supplied with water Leaders The chief of state is the titular leader of the country who represents the state at official and ceremonial funcions but is not involved with the daytoday activities of the government The head of government is the administrative leader who manages the daytoday activities of the government In the UK the monarch is the chief of state and the prime minister is the head of government In the US the President is both the chief of state and the head of government Life expectancy at birth The average number of years to be lived by a group of people all born in the same year if mortality at each age remains constant in the future Maritime claims The proximity of neighboring states may prevent some national claims from being fully extended Merchant marine All ships engaged in the carriage of goods All commercial vessels as opposed to all nonmilitary ships which excludes tugs fishing vessels offshore oil rigs etc Also a grouping of merchant ships by nationality or register Captive registerA register of ships maintained by a territory possession or colony primarily or exclusively for the use of ships owned in the parent country Also referred to as an offshore register the offshore equivalent of an internal register Ships on a captive register will fly the same flag as the parent country or a local variant of it but will be subject to the maritime laws and taxation rules of the offshore territory Although the nature of a captive register makes it especially desirable for ships owned in the parent country just as in the internal register the ships may also be owned abroad The captive register then acts as a flag of convenience register except that it is not the register of an independent state Flag of convenience registerA national register offering registration to a merchant ship not owned in the flag state The major flags of convenience FOC attract ships to their register by virtue of low fees low or nonexistent taxation of profits and liberal manning requirements True FOC registers are characterized by having relatively few of the ships registered actually owned in the flag state Thus while virtually any flag can be used for ships under a given set of circumstances an FOC register is one where the majority of the merchant fleet is owned abroad It is also referred to as an open register Flag stateThe nation in which a ship is registered and which holds legal jurisdiction over operation of the ship whether at home or abroad Differences in flag state maritime legislation determine how a ship is manned and taxed and whether a foreignowned ship may be placed on the register Internal registerA register of ships maintained as a subset of a national register Ships on the internal register fly the national flag and have that nationality but are subject to a separate set of maritime rules from those on the main national register These differences usually include lower taxation of profits manning by foreign nationals and usually ownership outside the flag state when it functions as an FOC register The Norwegian International Ship Register and Danish International Ship Register are the most notable examples of an internal register Both have been instrumental in stemming flight from the national flag to flags of convenience and in attracting foreignowned ships to the Norwegian and Danish flags Merchant shipA vessel that carries goods against payment of freight Commonly used to denote any nonmilitary ship but accurately restricted to commercial vessels only RegisterThe record of a ships ownership and nationality as listed with the maritime authorities of a country Also the compendium of such individual ships registrations Registration of a ship provides it with a nationality and makes it subject to the laws of the country in which registered the flag state regardless of the nationality of the ships ultimate owner Money figures All are expressed in contemporaneous US dollars unless otherwise indicated Net migration rate The balance between the number of persons entering and leaving a country during the year per  persons based on midyear population An excess of persons entering the country is referred to as net immigration  migrants population an excess of persons leaving the country as net emigration  migrants population Population Figures are estimates from the Bureau of the Census based on statistics from population censuses vital registration systems or sample surveys pertaining to the recent past and on assumptions about future trends Total fertility rate The average number of children that would be born per woman if all women lived to the end of their childbearing years and bore children according to a given fertility rate at each age Years All year references are for the calendar year CY unless indicated as fiscal year FY  THE WORLD FACTBOOK   Country Afghanistan

and livestock raising sheep and goats Economic considerations however have played second fiddle to political and military upheavals including the nineyear Soviet military occupation ended  February  and the continuing bloody civil war Over the past decade onethird of the population has fled the country with Pakistan sheltering some  million refugees and Iran perhaps  million Another  million have probably moved into and around urban areas within Afghanistan Large numbers of bridges buildings and factories have been destroyed or damaged by military action or sabotage Government claims to the contrary gross domestic product almost certainly is lower than  years ago because of the loss of labor and capital and the disruption of trade and transport Official claims indicate that agriculture

development lags behind even the least favored areas of the Yugoslav economy The Stalinisttype economy operates on the principles of central planning and state ownership of the means of production In recent years Albania has implemented limited economic reforms to stimulate its lagging economy although they do not go nearly so far as current reforms in the USSR and Eastern Europe Attempts at selfreliance and a policy of not borrowing from international lenderssometimes overlooked in recent yearshave greatly hindered the development of a broad economic infrastructure Albania however possesses considerable mineral resources and is largely selfsufficient in food Numerical estimates of Albanian economic activity are subject to an especially wide margin of error because the

for nearly all of its export receipts about  of government revenues and nearly  of GDP In  the sharp increase in oil prices led to a booming economy that helped to finance an ambitious program of industrialization Plunging oil and gas prices combined with the mismanagement of Algerias highly centralized economy have brought the nation to its most serious social and economic crisis since independence The government has promised farreaching reforms including giving public sector companies more autonomy encouraging privatesector activity boosting gas and nonhydrocarbon exports and a

four smaller yellow fivepointed stars arranged in a vertical arc toward the middle of the flag in the upper hoistside corner  Economy Overview Beginning in late  the Chinese leadership has been trying to move the economy from the sluggish Sovietstyle centrally planned economy to a more productive and flexible economy with market elementsbut still within the framework of monolithic Communist control To this end the authorities have switched to a system of household responsibility in agriculture in place of the old collectivization increased the authority of local officials and plant managers in industry permitted a wide variety of smallscale enterprise in services and light manufacturing and opened the foreign economic sector to increased trade and joint ventures The most gratifying result has been a strong spurt in production particularly in agriculture in the early s Otherwise the leadership has often experienced in its hybrid system the worst results of socialism bureaucracy lassitude corruption and of capitalism windfall gains and steppedup inflation Beijing thus has periodically backtracked retightening central controls at intervals and thereby undermining the credibility of the reform process Open inflation and excess demand continue to plague the economy and political repression following the crackdown at Tiananmen in mid has curtailed tourism foreign aid and new investment by foreign firms Popular resistance and changes in central policy have weakened Chinas population control program which is essential to the nations longterm economic viability GNP

the worlds most developed economies France has substantial agricultural resources and a highly diversified modern industrial sector Large tracts of fertile land the application of modern technology and subsidies have combined to make it the leading agricultural producer in Western Europe France is largely selfsufficient in agricultural products and is a major exporter of wheat and dairy products The industrial sector generates about onethird of GDP and employs about onethird of the work force During the period  economic growth was sluggish averaging only  annually This trend was reversed by late  however with a strong expansion of consumer demand followed by a surge in investment The economy has had difficulty generating enough jobs for new entrants into the labor force resulting in a high unemployment rate but the upward trend in growth recently pushed the jobless rate below  The steadily advancing economic integration within the European Community is a major force affecting the

the Gaza Strip their relationship with their neighbors and a peace treaty between Israel and Jordan are to be negotiated among the concerned parties Camp David further specifies that these negotiations will resolve the respective boundaries Pending the completion of this process it is US policy that the final status of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip has yet to be determined In the view of the US the term West Bank describes all of the area west of the Jordan under Jordanian administration before the  ArabIsraeli war With respect to negotiations envisaged in the framework agreement however it is US policy that a distinction must be made between Jerusalem and the rest of the West Bank because of the citys special status and circumstances Therefore a negotiated solution for the final status of Jerusalem could be different in character from that of the rest of the West Bank  Geography Total area km land area  km Comparative area slightly more than twice the size of

while leaving some smallscale industry and services and most agriculture to private enterprise The economy is dominated by the oil sector which provides about  of foreign exchange earnings Since the early s financial problems caused by war expenditures and damage to oil export facilities by Iran have led the government to implement austerity measures and to reschedule foreign debt payments Oil exports have gradually increased with the construction of new pipelines Agricultural development remains hampered by labor shortages salinization and dislocations caused by previous land reform and collectivization programs The industrial sector although accorded high priority by the government is under financial constraints New investment funds are generally allocated only to projects that

development In  per capita GNP was the highest in Africa at  but it had been  higher in  Severe cutbacks in imports over the past five years have led to shortages of basic goods and foodstuffs although the reopening of the LibyanTunisian border in April  and the LibyanEgyptian border in December  have somewhat eased shortages Austerity budgets and a lack of trained technicians have undermined the governments ability to implement a number of planned infrastructure development projects The nonoil industrial and construction sectors which account for about  of GNP have expanded from processing mostly agricultural products to include petrochemicals iron steel and aluminum Although agriculture accounts for less than  of GNP it employs  of the labor force Climatic conditions

Latin American countries the Netherlands Antilles has avoided large international debt Almost all consumer and capital goods are imported with the US being the major supplier The economy has suffered somewhat in recent years because of the depressed state of the world oil market and declining tax revenues In  the drop in oil prices led to the devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar which ended a

government deficits and heavy dependence on foreign aid In addition the economy must support a large military establishment and provide for the needs of  million Afghan refugees A real economic growth rate averaging  in recent years has enabled the country to cope with these problems Almost all agriculture and smallscale industry is in private hands and the government seeks to privatize a portion of the largescale industrial enterprises now publicly owned In December  Pakistan signed a threeyear economic reform agreement with the IMF which provides for a reduction in the government deficit and a liberalization of trade in return for further IMF financial support The socalled Islamization of the economy has affected mainly the financial sector for example a prohibition on certain types of interest payments Pakistan almost certainly will make little headway against its population problem at the current rate of growth population would double in  years GNP  billion per capita  real growth

of the South African population enjoy incomes material comforts and health and educational standards equal to those of Western Europe In contrast most of the remaining population suffers from the poverty patterns of the Third World including unemployment lack of job skills and barriers to movement into higherpaying fields Inputs and outputs thus do not move smoothly into the most productive employments and the effectiveness of the market is further lowered by international constraints on dealings with South Africa The main strength of the economy lies in its rich mineral resources which

General in Leningrad Flag red with the yellow silhouette of a crossed hammer and sickle below a yellowedged fivepointed red star in the upper hoistside corner  Economy Overview The first five years of perestroyka economic restructuring have undermined the institutions and processes of the Soviet command economy without replacing them with efficiently functioning markets The initial reforms featured greater authority for enterprise managers over prices wages product mix investment sources of supply and customers But in the absence of effective market discipline the result was the disappearance of lowprice goods excessive wage increases an even larger volume of unfinished construction projects and in general continued economic stagnation The Gorbachev regime has made at least four serious errors in economic policy in these five years the unpopular and shortlived antialcohol campaign the initial cutback in imports of consumer goods the failure to act decisively for the privatization of agriculture and the buildup of a massive overhang of unspent rubles in the hands of households and enterprises In October  a top economic adviser Leonid Abalkin presented an ambitious but reasonable timetable for the conversion to a partially privatized market system in the s In December  however Premier Ryzhkovs conservative approach prevailed namely the contention that a period of retrenchment was necessary to provide a stable financial and legislative base for launching further reforms Accordingly the new strategy was to put the reform process on hold in  by recentralizing economic authority and to placate the rankandfile through sharp increases in consumer goods output In still another policy twist the leadership in early  was considering a marked speedup in the marketization process Because the economy is caught in between two systems there was in  an even greater mismatch between what was produced and what would serve the best interests of enterprises and households

difficulties are attributable in part to severe drought in several recent years costly but unsuccessful attempts to match Israels military strength a falloff in Arab aid and insufficient foreign exchange earnings to buy needed inputs for industry and agriculture Socialist policy embodied in a thicket of bureaucratic regulations in many instances has driven away or pushed underground the mercantile and entrepreneurial spirit for which Syrian businessmen have long been famous Two bright spots a sizable number of villagers have benefited from land redistribution electrification and other rural development programs and a recent find of light crude oil has enabled Syria to cut back its substantial imports of light crude A longterm concern is the additional drain of upstream

amounts of maize sorghum cassava and sweet potatoes are also grown The government permits sale of surplus grain on the open market Most of the mineral resources are located in the north including coal which is an important export item Following the end of the war in  heavy handed government measures undermined efforts at an efficient merger of the agricultural resources of the south and the industrial resources of the north The economy remains heavily dependent on foreign aid and has received assistance from Communist countries Sweden and UN agencies Inflation although down from recent tripledigit levels is still a major weakness and per capita output is among the worlds lowest Since early  the government has sponsored a broad reform program that seeks to turn more economic activity

President Reagans  September  peace initiative the final status of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip their relationship with their neighbors and a peace treaty between Israel and Jordan are to be negotiated among the concerned parties Camp David further specifies that these negotiations will resolve the respective boundaries Pending the completion of this process it is US policy that the final status of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip has yet to be determined In the view of the US the term West Bank describes all of the area west of the Jordan River under Jordanian administration before the  ArabIsraeli war However with respect to negotiations envisaged in the framework agreement it is US policy that a distinction must be made between Jerusalem and the rest of the West Bank because of the citys special status and circumstances Therefore a negotiated solution for the final status of Jerusalem could be different in character from that of the rest of the West Bank  Geography Total

hampered by Israeli military occupation and the effects of the Palestinian uprising Industries using advanced technology or requiring sizable financial resources have been discouraged by a lack of financial resources and Israeli policy Capital investment has largely gone into residential housing not into productive assets that could compete with Israeli industry A major share of GNP is derived

equal horizontal bands of blue top white and red with a large red fivepointed star edged in yellow superimposed in the center over all three bands  Economy Overview Titos reform programs  years ago changed the Stalinist command economy to a decentralized semimarket system but a system that the rigid ethnically divided political structure ultimately could not accommodate A prominent feature of the reforms was the establishment of workers selfmanagement councils in all large plants which were to select managers stimulate production and divide the proceeds The general result of these reforms has been rampant wageprice inflation substantial rundown of capital plant consumer shortages and a still larger income gap between the poorer southern regions and the relatively affluent northern provinces of Hrvatska and Slovenija In  the beleaguered central government has been reforming the reforms trying to create an open market economy with still considerable state ownership of major industrial plants These reforms have been moving forward with the advice and support of the International Monetary Fund through a series of tough negotiations Selfmanagement supposedly is to be replaced by the discipline of the market and by fiscal austerity ultimately leading to a stable dinar However strikes in major plants hyperinflation and interregional political jousting have held back progress According to US economic advisers only a highly unlikely combination of genuine privatization massive Western economic investment and aid and political moderation can salvage this economy GNP
