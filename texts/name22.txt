 Produced by MICRA Inc Rogets Thesaurus by Peter Mark Roget This is the Project Gutenberg Etext of Rogets Thesaurus No Two It has not been compared with the rogettxt so keep both This edition should be labeled rogetatxt or rogetazip   Thesaurus   Version  supplemented July      An electronic thesaurus derived from the version of Rogets Thesaurus published in  This thesaurus has been prepared by MICRA Inc May   MICRA Inc makes no representation that the original  printed work on which this is based is now in the public domain in any particular country However MICRA Inc makes no proprietary claims regarding this electronic version of the  thesaurus If the  work is currently public domain this electronic version can also be treated as public domain If any commercial use is made of this work prior to January   it is suggested that an appropriate donation be made to MICRA Inc to assist in preparing other such texts which may be useful  Note that this version of Thesaurus has been supplemented with over  words not present in the original  edition but many modern words are still missing About  verbs out of  which can be found in an word spellchecker are absent from this work The deficiency of nouns is probably much worse especially on technical topics Of  unique words contained in the original text  are not recognized by a spellchecker Most of these are foreign words primarily Latin and many are obsolete In this version these words are marked as such by comments in square brackets Although this version has been proofread there are doubtless numerous residual transcription errors some of which may be obvious even without reference to the original text We will be grateful if any of these are brought to our attention the corrections will appear in subsequent versions The original arrangement has also been modified slightly in several places in particular by splitting one entry into two A version of the  thesaurus which is almost identical to the original only a small number of additions to the original work has also been prepared by MICRA Inc and also carries no restrictions from MICRA Copies of that version or this one may be purchased for  from MICRA Inc or from the Austin Code Works Austin Texas In this file comments which are not a proper part of the thesaurus itself are contained within arrow brackets thus  comment  Section headings which are not an actual part of the thesaurus proper are included between percent  markers Occasional references to numbers starting with  are the embryonic beginnings of a reorganized version mentioned below A few comments are also included within curly brackets  Last edit   The following additional differences will be noted between this version and the original edition of the printed  thesaurus  the spacesaving abbreviations in the original using hyphens to represent common words prefixes or suffixes have been expanded into the full words or phrases  the sidebyside format for words and their opposites has been abandoned Words are listed in order of their entry number  each main entry  entries has a pound sign  in front of the number to facilitate computerized search  Greek words and phrases are transliterated and included between brackets in the format grgreek wordgr  where italics occurred in the original italics are used in the Microsoft Word format file In the plain ASCII file this formatting is lost  in the original book words which were obsolete in  were marked with a dagger In this version those words are marked with a vertical bar  Some of the words which were still current in  but are no longer found in a current collegesize dictionary presently obsolete words or which are no longer used in the specific indicated sense have been marked with a bar followed by an exclamation point  However this marking process has just commenced and only a small portion of the words which are now obsolete have been thus marked Most though not all of the foreignlanguage phrases are now obsolete The obsolete notation obs indicates that the previous word or some word in the previous phrase is not recognized by the word processors spelling checker and also is either NOT in a modern collegesized dictionary or is noted there as being ARCHAIC  the approximate location of the bottom of each page in the original  printed book is indicated by a comment of the form  p   To search for a page note that there are two spaces between the p and the page number  This file contains only the main body of the thesaurus Neither outline nor index are contained here The outline with an overview of the organization of the concepts is contained in a separate file outlinedoc on the distribution disk This first edition of this supplemented  thesaurus June  is very much less complete than the latest editions of commercial thesauri and is probably not suitable for use as an adjunct to wordprocessing programs but it has no proprietary claims attached to it by MICRA Inc and does not contain any material published commercially after  Future copyrighted versions of this thesaurus are planned which will be reorganized in a hierarchical fashion to maximize the ability to take advantage of inheritance of semantic characteristics from higher categories The objective is to create a database of words organized by semantic categories suitable for use in naturallanguage understanding programs This is a very smallscale project which will not be competitive with large academic or commercial efforts such as the CYC project but is intended to provide a convenient resource for experimentation in naturallanguage processing for individuals or small groups Anyone who is currently engaged in or contemplating a similar thesaurus or dictionary project who would be willing to collaborate on this project is encouraged to contact us so that unnecessary duplication of effort can be avoided We would also appreciate being notified of typos errors or omissions in any
