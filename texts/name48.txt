an extremely poor landlocked country highly dependent on farming wheat especially and livestock raising sheep and goats Economic considerations however have played second fiddle to political and military upheavals during more than  years of war including the nearly year Soviet military occupation which ended  February  Over the past decade onethird of the population fled the country with Pakistan sheltering more than  million refugees and Iran about  million Another  million probably moved into and around urban areas within Afghanistan Although reliable data are unavailable gross

unemployment rate estimated at  For over  years the Stalinisttype economy has operated on the principle of central planning and state ownership of the means of production Albania began fitful economic reforms during  including the liberalization of prices and trade the privatization of shops and transport and land reform These reform measures were crippled however by the widespread civil disorder that accompanied the collapse of the Communist state Following their overwhelming victory in the  March  elections the new Democratic government announced a program of shock therapy to stabilize the economy and establish a market economy In an effort to expand international ties Tirane has reestablished diplomatic relations with the former Soviet Union and the US and has joined the IMF and World Bank The Albanians have also passed legislation allowing foreign investment Albania possesses considerable mineral resources and until  was largely selfsufficient in food however the breakup of

Armenia Government Flag NA Armenia Economy Overview Armenia under the old centrally planned Soviet system had built up textile machinebuilding and other industries and had become a key supplier to sister republics In turn Armenia had depended on supplies of raw materials and energy from the other republics Most of these supplies enter the republic by rail through Azerbaijan  and Georgia  The economy has been severely hurt by ethnic strife with Azerbaijan over control of the NagornoKarabakh Autonomous Oblast a mostly Armenianpopulated enclave within the national boundaries of Azerbaijan In addition to outright warfare the strife has included interdiction of Armenian imports on the Azerbaijani railroads and expensive airlifts of supplies to beleagured Armenians in NagornoKarabakh An earthquake in December  destroyed about onetenth of industrial capacity and housing the repair of which has not been possible because the supply of funds and real resources has been disrupted by the reorganization and subsequent dismantling of the central USSR administrative apparatus Among facilities made unserviceable by the earthquake are the Yerevan nuclear power plant which had supplied  of Armenias needs for electric power and a plant that produced onequarter of the output of elevators in the former USSR Armenia has some deposits of nonferrous metal ores bauxite copper zinc and molybdenum that are largely unexploited For the midterm Armenias economic prospects seem particularly bleak because of ethnic strife and the unusually high dependence on outside areas themselves in a

Economy Overview Bosnia and Herzegovina ranked next to Macedonia as the poorest component in the old Yugoslav federation Although agriculture has been almost all in private hands farms have been small and inefficient and the republic traditionally has been a net importer of food Industry has been greatly overstaffed one reflection of the rigidities of Communist central planning and management Tito had pushed the development of military industries in the republic with the result that Bosnia hosted a large share of Yugoslavias defense plants As of April  the newly independent republic was being torn apart by bitter interethnic warfare that has caused production to plummet unemployment and inflation to soar and human misery to multiply The survival of the republic as a political and economic unit is in doubt Both Serbia and Croatia have imposed various economic blockades and may permanently take over large areas populated by fellow ethnic groups These areas contain most of the industry If a much smaller core Muslim state survives it will share many Third World problems of poverty technological backwardness and dependence on historically soft foreign markets for its primary products In

hard currency earnings and leading the regime to declare a moratorium on its hard currency payments The postCommunist government faces major problems of renovating an aging industrial plant coping with worsening energy food and consumer goods shortages keeping abreast of rapidly unfolding technological developments investing in additional energy capacity the portion of electric power from nuclear energy reached over onethird in  and motivating workers in part by giving them a share in the earnings of their enterprises Bulgarias new government led by Prime Minister Filip Dimitrov is strongly committed to economic reform The previous government even though dominated by former Communists had taken the first steps toward dismantling the central planning system bringing the economy back into balance and reducing inflationary pressures The program produced some encouraging early results including eased restrictions on foreign investment increased support from international financial institutions and liberalized currency trading Small entrepreneurs have begun to emerge and some privatization of small enterprises has taken place The government has passed bills to

managers in industry permitted a wide variety of smallscale enterprise in services and light manufacturing and opened the foreign economic sector to increased trade and joint ventures The most gratifying result has been a strong spurt in production particularly in agriculture in the early s Industry also has posted major gains especially in coastal areas near Hong Kong and opposite Taiwan where foreign investment and modern production methods have helped spur production of both domestic and export goods Aggregate output has more than doubled since  On the darker side the leadership has often experienced in its hybrid system the worst results of socialism bureaucracy lassitude corruption and of capitalism windfall gains and steppedup inflation Beijing thus has periodically backtracked retightening central controls at intervals and thereby lessening the credibility of the reform process In  output rose substantially particularly in the favored coastal areas Popular

capita output roughly comparable to that of Portugal and perhaps onethird above the Yugoslav average Serbia and the Serbdominated army of the old Yugoslavia however have seized Croatian territory and the overriding determinant of Croatias longterm economic prospects will be the final border settlement Under the most favorable circumstances Croatia will retain the Dalmatian coast with its major tourist attractions and Slavonia with its oilfields and rich agricultural land Even so Croatia would face monumental problems stemming from the legacy of longtime Communist mismanagement of the economy large foreign debt damage during the fighting to bridges factories powerlines buildings and houses and the disruption of economic ties to Serbia and the other former Yugoslav republics At the

economy centrally planned and largely state owned is highly dependent on the agricultural sector and foreign trade Sugar provided about twothirds of export revenues in  and over half was exported to the former Soviet republics The economy has stagnated since  under policies that have deemphasized material incentives in the workplace abolished farmers informal produce markets and raised prices of governmentsupplied goods and services In  the economy probably fell  largely as a result of declining trade with the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe Recently the government has been trying to increase trade with Latin America and China Cuba has had difficulty servicing its foreign debt since  The government currently is encouraging foreign investment in tourist facilities and in industrial plants idled by falling imports from the former Soviet Union Other investment priorities include sugar basic foods and nickel The annual Soviet subsidy dropped from  billion in  to about  billion in  because of a lower price paid for Cuban sugar and a sharp decline in Soviet exports to Cuba The former Soviet republics have indicated they will no longer extend aid to Cuba beginning in  Instead of

economies most industrial plants being owned by the government Overregulation holds back technical modernization and foreign investment Even so the economy grew rapidly during the late s and early s but in  the collapse of world oil prices and an increasingly heavy burden of debt servicing led Egypt to begin negotiations with the IMF for balanceofpayments support As part of the  agreement with the IMF the government agreed to institute a reform program to reduce inflation promote economic growth and improve its external position The reforms have been slow in coming however and the economy has been largely stagnant for the past four years The addition of  million people every seven months to Egypts population exerts enormous pressure on the  of the total land area available for

farming which directly or indirectly employs most of the work force A few dairy herds are kept to meet domestic consumption of milk and milk products and crops grown are primarily those for providing winter fodder Exports feature shipments of highgrade wool to the UK and the sale of postage stamps and coins Rich stocks of fish in the surrounding waters are not presently exploited by the islanders So far efforts to establish a domestic fishing industry have been unsuccessful In  the government began selling fishing licenses to foreign trawlers operating within the Falklands exclusive fishing zone These license fees amount to more than  million per year and are a primary source of income for the government To encourage tourism the Falkland Islands Development Corporation has built three

allimportant fishing industry and with an external debt twice the size of annual income When the nations of the world extended their fishing zones to  nautical miles in the early s the Faroese no longer could continue their traditional longdistance fishing and subsequently depleted their own nearby fishing areas The governments tight controls on fish stocks and its austerity measures have caused a recession and subsidy cuts will force further reductions in the fishing industry which has already been plagued with bankrupcies An annual Danish subsidy of  million continues to provide

threefourths the US figure Its main economic force is the manufacturing sector  principally the wood metals and engineering industries Trade is important with the export of goods representing about  of GDP Except for timber and several minerals Finland depends on imported raw materials energy and some components of manufactured goods Because of the climate agricultural development is limited to maintaining selfsufficiency in basic commodities The economy which experienced an average of  annual growth between  and  sank into a deep recession in  as growth contracted by  The recession  which is expected to bottom out in late   has been caused by economic overheating depressed foreign markets and the dismantling of the barter system between Finland and the former Soviet Union in which Soviet oil and gas had been exchanged for Finnish manufactured goods The Finnish Government has proposed efforts to increase industrial competitiveness and efficiency by an increase in exports to Western markets cuts in public expenditures partial privatization of state enterprises and foreign investment and exchange liberalization Helsinki tied the markkaa to the ECs European Currency Unit to promote stability but was forced to devalue the markkaa by about  in November  The devaluation should improve industrial competitiveness and business confidence in  Finland as a member of EFTA

period  oil accounted for about  of GDP  of export earnings and  of government revenues on average The high oil prices of the early s contributed to a substantial increase in per capita income stimulated domestic demand reinforced migration from rural to urban areas and raised the level of real wages to among the highest in SubSaharan Africa The threeyear slide of Gabons economy which began with falling oil prices in  was reversed in  because of a near doubling of oil prices over their  lows In  the economy posted strong growth despite serious strikes but debt servicing problems are

the Sinai and the Golan Heights As stated in the  Camp David accords and reaffirmed by President Bushs post  Gulf crisis peace initiative the final status of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip their relationship with their neighbors and a peace treaty between Israel and Jordan are to be negotiated among the concerned parties Camp David further specifies that these negotiations will resolve the respective boundaries Pending the completion of this process it is US policy that the final status of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip has yet to be determined In the US view the term West Bank describes all of the area west of the Jordan River under Jordanian administration before the  ArabIsraeli war With respect to negotiations envisaged in the framework agreement however it is US policy that a distinction must be made between Jerusalem and the rest of the West Bank because of the citys special status and circumstances Therefore a negotiated solution for the final status of Jerusalem could be different in character from that of the rest of the West Bank The Gaza Strip is currently governed by Israeli military authorities and Israeli civil administration it is US policy that the final status of the Gaza Strip will be determined by negotiations among the concerned parties these negotiations will determine how this area is to be governed There are  Jewish settlements in the

New York  Flag maroon field with small rectangle in upper left corner rectangle divided horizontally with black on top white below Georgia Economy Overview Among the former Soviet republics Georgia is noted for its Black Sea tourist industry its large output of citrus fruits and tea and the amazing diversity of an industrial sector that accounted however for less than  of the USSRs output Another salient characteristic of the economy has been a flourishing private sector compared with the other republics Almost  of the labor force is employed in agriculture and  in industry Mineral resources consist of manganese and copper and to a lesser extent molybdenum arsenic tungsten and mercury Except for very small quantities of domestic oil gas and coal fuel must be imported from neighboring republics Oil and its products are delivered by pipeline from Azerbaijan to the port of Batumi for export and local refining Gas is supplied in pipelines from Krasnodar and Stavropol Georgia is nearly selfsufficient in electric power thanks to abundant hydropower stations as well as some thermal power stations The dismantling of central economic controls is being delayed by political factionalism marked by armed struggles between the elected government and the opposition and industrial output seems to have fallen more steeply in Georgia in  than in any other of the former Soviet republics To prevent further economic decline Georgia must establish domestic peace and must maintain economic ties to the other former Soviet republics while developing new links to the West GDP purchasing power

Germany Economy Overview The Federal Republic of Germany is making substantial progress in integrating and modernizing eastern Germany but at a heavy economic cost Western Germanys growth in  slowed to   the lowest rate since   because of slack world growth and higher interest rates and taxes required by the unification process While western Germanys economy was in recession in the last half of  eastern Germanys economy bottomed out after a nearly twoyear freefall and shows signs of recovery particularly in the construction transportation and service sectors Eastern Germany could begin a fragile recovery later concentrated in  in construction transportation and services The two regions remain vastly different however despite eastern Germanys progress Western Germany has an advanced market economy and is a world leader in exports It has a highly urbanized and skilled population that enjoys excellent living standards abundant leisure time and comprehensive social welfare benefits Western Germany is relatively poor in natural resources coal being the most important mineral Western Germanys worldclass companies manufacture technologically advanced goods The regions economy is mature services and manufacturing account for the dominant share of economic activity and raw materials and semimanufactured goods constitute a large portion of imports In recent years manufacturing has accounted for about  of GDP with other sectors contributing lesser amounts Gross fixed investment in  accounted for about  of GDP In  GDP in the western region was an estimated  per capita In contrast eastern Germanys economy is shedding the obsolete heavy industries that dominated the economy during the Communist era Eastern Germanys share of allGerman GDP is only about  and eastern productivity is just  that of the west The privatization agency for eastern Germany the Treuhand is rapidly selling many of the  firms under its control The pace of private investment is starting to pick up but questions about property rights and environmental liabilities remain Eastern Germany has one of the worlds largest reserves of lowgrade lignite coal but little else in the way of mineral resources The quality of statistics from eastern Germany is improving yet many gaps remain the federal government began producing allGerman data for select economic statistics at the start of  The most challenging economic problem is promoting eastern Germanys economic reconstruction  specifically finding the right mix of fiscal monetary regulatory and tax policies that will spur investment in eastern Germany  without destabilizing western Germanys economy or damaging relations with West European partners The biggest danger is that excessive wage settlements and heavy federal borrowing could fuel inflation and prompt the German Central Bank the Bundesbank to keep a tight monetary policy to choke off a wageprice spiral Meanwhile the FRG has been providing billions of dollars to help

industry and agriculture  although handicapped by geographic limitations and fragmented small farms  is selfsufficient except for meat dairy products and animal feedstuffs The Mitsotakis government inherited several severe economic problems from the preceding socialist and caretaker administrations which had neglected the runaway budget deficit a ballooning current account deficit and accelerating inflation In early  the government secured a  billion assistance package from the EC under the strictest terms yet imposed on a member country as the EC finally ran out of patience with Greeces failure to put its financial affairs in order Over the next three years Athens must bring inflation down to  cut the current account deficit and central government borrowing as a percentage of

on subsistence whaling hunting and fishing to one dependent on foreign trade Fishing is still the most important industry accounting for over  of exports and about  of the populations income Maintenance of a social welfare system similar to Denmarks has given the public sector a dominant role in the economy In  the economy became critically dependent on shrimp exports and on an annual subsidy now about  million from the Danish Government because cod exports dropped off and commercial mineral production stopped As of  the government also has taken control of the health sector from

during the Communist era gave it a head start in creating a market economy and attracting foreign investment In  Hungary received half of all foreign investment in Eastern Europe and in  received the largest single share The growing private sector accounts for onequarter to onethird of national output according to unofficial estimates Privatization of state enterprises is progressing although excessive redtape bureaucratic oversight and uncertainties about pricing have slowed the process Escalating unemployment and high rates of inflation may impede efforts to speed up privatization and

low unemployment and comparatively even distribution of income The economy is heavily dependent on the fishing industry which provides nearly  of export earnings In the absence of other natural resources Icelands economy is vulnerable to changing world fish prices The economic improvements resulting from climbing fish prices in  and a noninflationary labor agreement probably will be reversed by tighter fish quotas and a delay in the construction of an aluminum smelting plant The conservative governments economic priorities include reducing the budget and current account deficits containing inflation revising agricultural and fishing policies diversifying the economy and tying the krona to the ECs European currency unit in  The fishing industries  notably the shrimp industry  are experiencing a series of bankruptcies and mergers Inflation has continued to drop sharply from  in  to about  in  and possibly  in  while unemployment is expected to increase to  GDP is expected

extensive natural wealth yet with a large and rapidly increasing population it remains a poor country GDP growth in  averaged about  quite impressive but not sufficient to both slash underemployment and absorb the  million workers annually entering the labor force Agriculture including forestry and fishing is an important sector accounting for  of GDP and over  of the labor force The staple crop is rice Once the worlds largest rice importer Indonesia is now nearly selfsufficient Plantation crops  rubber and palm oil  and textiles and plywood are being encouraged for both export and job generation Industrial output now accounts for  of GDP and is based on a supply of diverse natural resources including crude oil natural gas timber metals and coal Of these the oil sector dominates the external economy generating more than  of the governments revenues and  of export earnings in  However the economys growth is highly dependent on the continuing expansion of nonoil exports Japan is Indonesias most important customer and supplier of aid In  rapid growth in the money supply prompted Jakarta to implement a tight monetary policy forcing the private sector to go to foreign banks for

village agriculture and smallscale private trading and service ventures After a decade of economic decline Irans GNP grew roughly  in FY and  in FY An oil windfall in  combined with a substantial increase in imports contributed to Irans recent economic growth Iran has also begun implementing a number of economic reforms to reduce government intervention including subsidies and has allocated substantial resources to development projects in the hope of stimulating the economy Nevertheless lower oil revenues in   oil accounts for more than  of export revenues and provides roughly  of the financing for the fiveyear economic development plan  and dramatic increases in external debt are threatening development plans and could prompt Iran to cut imports thus limiting economic growth in

and most agriculture to private enterprise The economy has been dominated by the oil sector which has provided about  of foreign exchange earnings In the s financial problems caused by massive expenditures in the eightyear war with Iran and damage to oil export facilities by Iran led the government to implement austerity measures and to borrow heavily and later reschedule foreign debt payments After the end of hostilities in  oil exports gradually increased with the construction of new pipelines and restoration of damaged facilities Agricultural development remained hampered by labor shortages salinization and dislocations caused by previous land reform and collectivization programs The industrial sector although accorded high priority by the government also was under financial constraints Iraqs seizure of Kuwait in August  subsequent international economic embargoes and military actions by an international coalition beginning in January  drastically changed the economic picture Oil exports were cut to near zero and industrial and transportation facilities were severely damaged Throughout  the UNs economic embargo worked to reduce exports and imports and to

benefited from increased Arab aid during the oil boom of the late s and early s when its annual GNP growth averaged more than  In the remainder of the s however reductions in both Arab aid and worker remittances slowed economic growth to an average of roughly  per year Imports  mainly oil capital goods consumer durables and food  have been outstripping exports with the difference covered by aid remittances and borrowing In mid the Jordanian Government began debtrescheduling negotiations and agreed to implement an IMF program designed to gradually reduce the budget deficit and implement badly needed structural reforms The Persian Gulf crisis that began in August  however aggravated Jordans already serious economic problems forcing the government to shelve the IMF program stop most debt payments and suspend rescheduling negotiations Aid from Gulf Arab states and worker remittances have plunged and refugees have flooded the country straining government resources Economic recovery is

Lebanon was torn by civil war between its Christians  then aided by Syrian troops  and its Muslims and their Palestinian allies The ceasefire established in October  between the domestic political groups generally held for about six years despite occasional fighting Syrian troops constituted as the Arab Deterrent Force by the Arab League have remained in Lebanon Syrias move toward supporting the Lebanese Muslims and the Palestinians and Israels growing support for Lebanese Christians brought the two sides into rough equilibrium but no progress was made toward national reconciliation or political reforms  the original cause of the war Continuing Israeli concern about the Palestinian presence in Lebanon led to the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in June  Israeli forces occupied all of the southern portion of the country and mounted a summerlong siege of Beirut which resulted in the evacuation of the PLO from Beirut in September under the supervision of a multinational force MNF made up of US French and Italian troops Within days of the departure of the MNF Lebanons newly elected president Bashir Gemayel was assassinated his elder brother Amin was elected to succeed him In the immediate wake of Bashirs death however Christian militiamen massacred hundreds of Palestinian refugees in two Beirut camps This prompted the return of the MNF to ease the security burden on Lebanons weak Army and security forces In late March  the last MNF units withdrew In  President Gemayel completed his term of office Because parliamentarians failed to elect a presidential successor Gemayel appointed then Lebanese Armed Forces LAF Commander Gen Michel Awn acting president Lebanese parliamentarians met in Taif Saudi Arabia in late  and concluded a national reconciliation pact that codified a new powersharing formula specifying reduced powers for the Christian president and giving Muslims more authority Rene MUAWAD was subsequently elected president on  November  ending a month period during which Lebanon had no president and rival Muslim and Christian governments MUAWAD was assassinated  days later on  November on  November Ilyas Harawi was elected to succeed MUAWAD In October  the civil war was apparently brought to a conclusion when Syrian and Lebanese forces ousted renegade Christian General Awn from his stronghold in East Beirut Awn had defied the legitimate government and established a separate ministate within East Beirut after being appointed acting Prime Minister by outgoing President Gemayel in  Awn and his supporters feared Taif would diminish Christian power in Lebanon and increase the influence of Syria Awn was granted amnesty and allowed to travel in France in August l Since the removal of Awn the Lebanese Government has made substantial progress in strengthening the central government rebuilding government institutions and extending its authority throughout the nation The LAF has deployed from Beirut north along the coast road to Tripoli southeast into the Shuf mountains and south to Sidon and Tyre Many militiamen from Christian and Muslim groups have evacuated Beirut for their strongholds in the north south and east of the country Some heavy weapons possessed by the militias have been turned over to the government or sold outside the country which has begun a plan to integrate some militiamen into the military and the

Lebanese system Lebanon Economy Overview Since  civil war has seriously damaged Lebanons economic infrastructure cut national output by half and all but ended Lebanons position as a Middle Eastern entrepot and banking hub Following October  however a tentative peace has enabled the central government to begin restoring control in Beirut collect taxes and regain access to key port and government facilities The battered economy has also been propped up by a financially sound banking system and resilient small and mediumscale manufacturers Family remittances banking transactions manufactured and farm exports the narcotics trade and international emergency aid are main sources of foreign exchange In the relatively settled year of  industrial production agricultural output and exports showed substantial gains The further rebuilding of the warravaged country could provide a major stimulus to the economy in  provided that the political and military situation remains reasonably calm

depends primarily upon revenues from the oil sector which contributes practically all export earnings and about onethird of GDP Since  however the sharp drop in oil prices and the resulting decline in export revenues have adversely affected economic development In  per capita GDP was the highest in Africa at  but GDP growth rates have slowed and fluctuate sharply in response to changes in the world oil market Import restrictions and inefficient resource allocations have led to shortages of basic goods and foodstuffs although the reopening of the LibyanTunisian border in April  and the LibyanEgyptian border in December  have somewhat eased shortages Austerity budgets and a lack of trained technicians have undermined the governments ability to implement a number of planned infrastructure development projects Windfall revenues from the hike in world oil prices in late  improved the foreign payments position and resulted in a current account surplus for the first time in five years The nonoil manufacturing and construction sectors which account for about  of GDP have expanded from processing mostly agricultural products to include petrochemicals iron steel and aluminum Although agriculture accounts for about  of GDP it employs about  of the labor force Climatic conditions and poor soils severely limit farm output and Libya imports about  of its food

Overview Lithuania is striving to become a small independent largely privatized economy rather than a segment of a huge centrally planned economy Although substantially above average in living standards and technology in the old USSR Lithuania historically lagged behind Latvia and Estonia in economic development It is ahead of its Baltic neighbors however in implementing market reform The country has no important natural resources aside from its arable land and strategic location Industry depends entirely on imported materials that have come from the republics of the former USSR Lithuania benefits from its icefree port at Klaipeda on the Baltic Sea and its rail and highway hub at Vilnius which provides land communication between Eastern Europe and Russia Latvia Estonia and Belarus Industry produces a small assortment of highquality products ranging from complex machine tools to sophisticated consumer electronics Thanks to nuclear power Lithuania is presently selfsufficient in electricity exporting its surplus to Latvia and Belarus the nuclear facilities inherited from the USSR however have come under world scrutiny as seriously deficient in safety standards Agriculture is efficient compared with most of the former Soviet Union Lithuania holds first place in per capita consumption of meat second place for eggs and potatoes and fourth place for milk and dairy products Grain must be imported to support the meat and dairy industries As to economic reforms Lithuania is pressing ahead with plans to privatize at least  of stateowned property industry agriculture and housing having already sold many small enterprises using a voucher system Other government priorities include stimulating foreign investment by protecting the property rights of foreign firms and redirecting foreign trade away from Eastern markets to the more competitive Western markets For the moment Lithuania will remain highly dependent on Russia for energy raw

as the vital petroleum sector through largescale state enterprises and extensively subsidizes agricultural fishing and other sectors Norway also maintains an extensive welfare system that helps propel publicsector expenditures to slightly more than  of the GDP and results in one of the highest average tax burdens in the world  A small country with a high dependence on international trade Norway is basically an exporter of raw materials and semiprocessed goods with an abundance of small and mediumsized firms and is ranked among the major shipping nations The country is richly endowed with natural resources  petroleum hydropower fish forests and minerals  and is highly dependent on its oil sector to keep its economy afloat Although one of the governments main priorities is to reduce this dependency this situation is not likely to improve for years to come The government also hopes to reduce unemployment and strengthen and diversify the economy through tax reform and an expansionary  budget Forecasters predict that economic growth will rise slightly in  because of publicsector expansion and moderate improvements in private investment and demand Inflation will remain about  while unemployment continues at record levels of over  because of the weakness of the economy outside the oil sector Oslo a member of the European Free Trade Area is continuing to deregulate

addition the economy must support a large military establishment and provide for the needs of  million Afghan refugees A real economic growth rate averaging  in recent years has enabled the country to cope with these problems Almost all agriculture and smallscale industry is in private hands In  Pakistan embarked on a sweeping economic liberalization program to boost foreign and domestic private

government has been pushing the development of a tourist industry to relieve high unemployment which recently amounted to onethird of the labor force The gap in Reunion between the welloff and the poor is extraordinary and accounts for the persistent social tensions The white and Indian communities are substantially better off than other segments of the population often approaching European standards whereas indigenous groups suffer the poverty and unemployment typical of the poorer nations of the African continent The outbreak of severe rioting in February  illustrates the seriousness of socioeconomic tensions The economic wellbeing of Reunion depends heavily on continued financial assistance from France GDP exchange rate conversion   billion per capita   est real growth rate   est

Industry which accounts for about onethird of the labor force and generates over half the GDP suffers from an aging capital plant and persistent shortages of energy The year  witnessed about a  drop in industrial production because of energy and input shortages and labor unrest In recent years the agricultural sector has had to contend with flooding mismanagement shortages of inputs and disarray caused by the dismantling of cooperatives A shortage of fuel and equipment in  contributed to a lackluster harvest a problem compounded by corruption and a poor distribution system The new government is loosening the tight central controls of CEAUSESCUS command economy It has instituted moderate land reforms with more than onehalf of cropland now in private hands and it has liberalized private agricultural output Also the new regime is permitting the establishment of private enterprises largely in services handicrafts and smallscale industry A law providing for the privatization of large state firms has been passed Most of the large state firms have been converted into jointstock companies but the selling of shares and assets to private owners has been delayed While the government has halted the old policy of diverting food from domestic consumption to hard currency export markets supplies remain scarce in some areas Furthermore real wages in Romania fell about  in  contributing to the unrest which forced the resignation of ROMAN in September The new government continues to impose price ceilings on key consumer items GDP purchasing power equivalent   billion per capita  real

stock Russia depends on its worldclass deposits of oil and gas not only for its own needs but also for vital hard currency earnings Selfsufficient in coal and iron ore it has a crude steel production capacity of about  million tons second only to Japan Russias machinebuilding sector   of the old USSRs  lags behind world standards of efficiency and quality of product Other major industrial sectors  chemicals construction materials light industry and food processing  also suffer from quality problems obsolescent capital equipment and pollution Consumer goods have had lower priority and the product mix has not mirrored household preferences Furthermore the transition to a more marketoriented economy has disrupted channels of supply to factories and distribution outlets substantial imports of foods and medical supplies have helped maintain minimum standards of consumption Russia inherited  of the former USSRs defense production facilities and is experiencing major social problems during conversion of many of these plants to civilian production Russia produces almost half of the old USSRs farm products but most warmclimate crops must be imported Under the old USSR production of industrial and agricultural goods often was concentrated in a single firm or a single republic Today producing units often have lost their major customers and their major sources of supply and the market institutions and incentives for adjusting to the new political and economic situations are only slowly emerging Rankandfile Russians will continue to suffer major deprivations in  and beyond before the country begins to realize its great economic potential The comprehensive economic reform program enacted in January  faces many economic and political hurdles before it will

Diplomatic representation none US does not recognize Serbia and Montenegro Flag NA Serbia and Montenegro Economy Overview The swift collapse of the Yugoslav federation has been accompanied by bloody ethnic warfare the destabilization of republic boundaries and the breakup of important interrepublic trade flows The situation in Serbia and Montenegro remains fluid in view of the extensive political and military strife This new state faces major economic problems First like the other former Yugoslav republics Serbia and Montenegro depended on their sister republics for large amounts of foodstuffs energy supplies and manufactures Wide varieties in climate mineral resources and levels of technology among the six republics accentuated this interdependence as did the Communist practice of concentrating much industrial output in a small number of giant plants The breakup of many of the trade links the sharp drop in output as industrial plants lost suppliers and markets and the destruction of physical assets in the fighting all have contributed to the economic difficulties of the republics One singular factor in the economic situation of Serbia and Montenegro is the continuation in office of a Communist government that is primarily interested in political and military mastery not economic reform A further complication is the major economic sanctions by the leading industrial nations GDP exchange rate conversion   billion per capita  real growth rate NA  Inflation rate consumer prices  per month Unemployment rate  Budget NA Exports  billion fob

republics leading to further destruction of longestablished trade channels and to an influx of tens of thousands of Croatian refugees As in other former Communist areas in Eastern Europe economic reform has often sputtered not only because of the vested interests of old bosses in retaining old rules of the game but also because of the tangible losses experienced by rankandfile people in the transition to a more marketoriented system The key program for breaking up and privatizing major industrial firms has not yet begun Bright spots for encouraging Western investors are Slovenias

of the South African population enjoy incomes material comforts and health and educational standards equal to those of Western Europe In contrast most of the remaining population suffers from the poverty patterns of the Third World including unemployment lack of job skills and barriers to movement into higherpaying fields Inputs and outputs thus do not move smoothly into the most productive employments and the effectiveness of the market is further lowered by international constraints on dealings with South Africa The main strength of the economy lies in its rich mineral resources which provide twothirds of exports Average growth of less than  in output in recent years falls far short of the  to  level needed to absorb some  new entrants to the labor force annually Economic

a skilled labor force Timber hydropower and iron ore constitute the resource base of an economy that is heavily oriented toward foreign trade Privately owned firms account for about  of industrial output of which the engineering sector accounts for  of output and exports In the last few years however this extraordinarily favorable picture has been clouded by inflation growing absenteeism and a gradual loss of competitiveness in international markets The new centerright government facing a sagging economic situation which is unlikely to improve until  is pushing full steam ahead with economic reform proposals to end Swedens recession and to prepare for possible EC membership in  The freemarketoriented reforms are designed to spur growth maintain price stability lower unemployment create a more efficient welfare state and further adapt to EC standards The measures include cutting taxes particularly the valueadded tax VAT and levies on new and small business privatization liberalizing foreign ownership restrictions and opening the welfare system to competition and private alternatives which the government will still finance Growth is expected to remain flat in  but

growth averaged nearly  annually in  buoyed by increased oil production and improved agricultural performance The Gulf war of early  provided Syria an aid windfall of several billion dollars from Arab

Turkey launched in  have begun to peter out Although real growth in per capita GDP averaged  annually between  and  recent economic performance has fallen substantially Moreover inflation and interest rates remain high and a large budget deficit will continue to provide difficulties for a country undergoing a substantial transformation from a centrally controlled to a free market economy Agriculture remains an important economic sector employing about half of the work force accounting for  of GDP and contributing  to exports The government has launched a multibilliondollar development program in the southeastern region which includes the building of a dozen dams on the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers to generate electric power and irrigate large tracts of farmland The planned tapping of huge additional quantities of Euphrates water has raised serious concern in the downstream riparian nations of Syria and Iraq The Turkish economy emerged from the Gulf War of early  in stronger shape than Ankara had expected Although the negative effects of the crisis were felt primarily in the politically sensitive southeast aid pledges by the coalition allies of more than  billion have

more than three times the output of the nextranking republic Its fertile black soil generated more than one fourth of Soviet agricultural output and its farms provided substantial quantities of meat milk grain and vegetables to other republics Likewise its welldeveloped and diversified heavy industry supplied equipment and raw materials to industrial and mining sites in other regions of the USSR In early  the continued wholesale disruption of economic ties and the lack of an institutional structure necessary to formulate and implement economic reforms preclude a nearterm recovery of output

accounted for only  of total Soviet output it produced twothirds of the USSRs cotton Moscows push for everincreasing amounts of cotton included massive irrigation projects which caused extensive environmental damage to the Aral Sea and rivers of the republic Furthermore the lavish use of chemical fertilizers has caused extensive pollution and widespread health problems Recently the republic has sought to encourage food production at the expense of cotton The small industrial sector specializes in such items as agricultural machinery mineral fertilizers vegetable oil and electrical cranes

Arab states in June  ended with Israel in control of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip the Sinai and the Golan Heights As stated in the  Camp David Accords and reaffirmed by President Bushs postGulf crisis peace initiative the final status of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip their relationship with their neighbors and a peace treaty between Israel and Jordan are to be negotiated among the concerned parties Camp David further specifies that these negotiations will resolve the respective boundaries Pending the completion of this process it is US policy that the final status of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip has yet to be determined In the view of the US the term West Bank describes all of the area west of the Jordan River under Jordanian administration before the  ArabIsraeli war

progress in the West Bank has been hampered by Israeli military administration and the effects of the Palestinian uprising intifadah Industries using advanced technology or requiring sizable investment have been discouraged by a lack of local capital and restrictive Israeli policies Capital investment consists largely of residential housing not productive assets that would enable local firms to compete with Israeli industry A major share of GNP is derived from remittances of workers employed in Israel and Persian Gulf states but such transfers from the Gulf dropped dramatically after Iraq invaded Kuwait in August  In the wake of the Persian Gulf crisis many Palestinians have returned to the West Bank increasing unemployment and export revenues have plunged because of the loss of markets in Jordan and the Gulf states Israeli measures to curtail the intifadah also have pushed unemployment up and lowered living standards The areas economic outlook remains bleak GNP

South Africa Gross domestic product GDP The value of all goods and services produced domestically Gross national product GNP The value of all goods and services produced domestically plus income earned abroad minus income earned by foreigners from domestic production GNPGDP methodology In the Economy section GNPGDP dollar estimates for the OECD countries the former Soviet republics and the East European countries are derived from purchasing power parity PPP calculations rather than from conversions at official currency exchange rates The PPP method normally involves the use of international dollar price weights which are applied to the quantities of goods and services produced in a given economy In addition to the lack of reliable data from the majority of countries the statistician faces a major difficulty in specifying identifying and allowing for the quality of goods and services The division of a PPP GNPGDP estimate in dollars by the corresponding estimate in the local currency gives the PPP conversion rate One thousand dollars will buy the same market basket of goods in the US as one thousand dollars  converted to the local currency at the PPP conversion rate  will buy in the other country GNPGDP estimates for the LDCs on the other hand are based on the conversion of GNPGDP estimates in local currencies to dollars at the official currency exchange rates One caution the proportion of say defense expenditures as a percent of GNPGDP in local currency accounts may differ substantially from the proportion when GNPGDP accounts are expressed in PPP terms as for example when an observer estimates the dollar level of Russian or Japanese military expenditures similar problems exist when components are expressed in dollars under currency exchange rate procedures Finally as academic research moves forward on the PPP method we hope to convert all GNPGDP estimates to this method in future editions of The World Factbook Growth rate population The annual percent change in the population resulting from a surplus or deficit of births over deaths and the balance of migrants entering and leaving a country The rate may be positive or negative Illicit drugs There are five categories of illicit drugs  narcotics stimulants depressants sedatives hallucinogens and cannabis These categories include many drugs legally produced and prescribed by

available only in the printed version for the fore seeable future Maritime claims The proximity of neighboring states may prevent some national claims from being fully extended Merchant marine All ships engaged in the carriage of goods All commercial vessels as opposed to all nonmilitary ships which excludes tugs fishing vessels offshore oil rigs etc also a grouping of merchant ships by nationality or register Captive register  A register of ships maintained by a territory possession or colony primarily or exclusively for the use of ships owned in the parent country also referred to as an offshore register the offshore equivalent of an internal register Ships on a captive register will fly the same flag as the parent country or a local variant of it but will be subject to the maritime laws and taxation rules of the offshore territory Although the nature of a captive register makes it especially desirable for ships owned in the parent country just as in the internal register the ships may also be owned abroad The captive register then acts as a flag of convenience register except that it is not the register of an independent state Flag of convenience register  A national register offering registration to a merchant ship not owned in the flag state The major flags of convenience FOC attract ships to their register by virtue of low fees low or nonexistent taxation of profits and liberal manning requirements True FOC registers are characterized by having relatively few of the ships registered actually owned in the flag state Thus while virtually any flag can be used for ships under a given set of circumstances an FOC register is one where the majority of the merchant fleet is owned abroad It is also referred to as an open register Flag state  The nation in which a ship is registered and which holds legal jurisdiction over operation of the ship whether at home or abroad Differences in flag state maritime legislation determine how a ship is manned and taxed and whether a foreignowned ship may be placed on the register Internal register  A register of ships maintained as a subset of a national register Ships on the internal register fly the national flag and have that nationality but are subject to a separate set of maritime rules from those on the main national register These differences usually include lower taxation of profits manning by foreign nationals and usually ownership outside the flag state when it functions as an FOC register The Norwegian International Ship Register and Danish International Ship Register are the most notable examples of an internal register Both have been instrumental in stemming flight from the national flag to flags of convenience and in attracting foreignowned ships to the Norwegian and Danish flags Merchant ship  A vessel that carries goods against payment of freight commonly used to denote any nonmilitary ship but accurately restricted to commercial vessels only Register  The record of a ships ownership and nationality as listed with the maritime authorities of a country also the compendium of such individual ships registrations Registration of a ship provides it with a nationality and makes it subject to the laws of the country in which registered the flag state regardless of the nationality of the ships ultimate owner Money figures All are expressed in contemporaneous US dollars unless otherwise indicated Net migration rate The balance between the number of persons entering and leaving a country during the year per  persons based on midyear population An excess of persons entering the country is referred to as net immigration  migrants population an excess of persons leaving the country as net emigration  migrants population Population
